<hr class="decor">

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">A few</span> words of preface
concerning a country so little known as that in which these pages
were written may, perhaps, be useful to the reader. For the sake of
those who may be interested in its past history or present
condition, I shall indicate the sources which will supply further
information.</p>

<p>Cyrenaica, or, as it was called under the Ptolemys, Pentapolis,
is situated on the northern coast of Africa, between Carthage and
Egypt. In its commercial importance it once almost rivalled the
former, and in the fertility of its soil, the latter. Its early
political vicissitudes are little known in detail, nearly all the
works which were specially dedicated to its history having
disappeared in the wreck of ages, among which the most to be
regretted is the Book on the Republic of Cyrene, which Aristotle
inserted in his Politics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>The Cyrenaica
presents a succession of hills and table-lands, bounded on the east
by the barren plains of Marmarica; to the south it is separated
from the Great Desert of Libya by the hills of Hercules and the
Velpa Mountains; on the north and west it is washed by the
Mediterranean. Its insular position amidst water and sands afforded
considerable security as well as great facilities for commerce. In
contrast with the countries on either hand, it was well watered
with frequent rains and perennial springs, so that it seemed an
earthly Paradise, well fitted to be the site of the Garden of the
Hesperides, or the abode of the Lotos-eaters.</p>

<p>Cyrene, the capital of the country, was founded by a colony of
Theræans, who quitted their native island in the Ægean Sea in the
latter half of the seventh century <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>,
under the conduct of Battus the Dorian. He was said to derive his
origin from the Minyæ, the descendants of the Argonauts, and was
pointed out by the Pythian Oracle to be the founder, with his
countrymen, of a colony in Libya. The inhabitants of Thera, says
the story, did not even know where Libya was situated, and,
returning home, neglected to comply with the orders of the god. At
length, admonished by a severe calamity—the total cessation of rain
for seven years, and the consequent destruction of all the trees in
the island excepting one—they sent one of their<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span> number into Crete, whose
inhabitants were of kin to them, to inquire if any one there had
ever heard of Libya. One Corobius undertook to be their guide. With
him they sailed to the island of Platæa, in the Gulf of Bomba and
(after taking possession of it) returned home with the news.
Thereupon, Battus, “alike distinguished by nobility of birth and
genius,” was despatched, with two fifty-oar galleys, as king, to
the new colony.</p>

<p>The situation thus chosen was an unfavourable one, for the
island was small and barren. After suffering great privations, its
inhabitants left it for the mainland, and at length, under conduct
of the Galigammæ, one of the Libyan tribes, (who were tired of the
new comers, and in return had proved themselves troublesome
neighbours,) they settled around the fountain of Cyre, which issues
from a cave in the side of a hill about twelve miles from the
sea-shore; and returned thanks to the god under whose auspices they
had found at length a new home in the midst of a fertile country,
“under an open heaven.”</p>

<p>Cyre was a daughter of the king of the Lapithæ, and displayed
her courage in combats with the wild beasts, which attacked her
father’s herds. One day being seen by Apollo, when, in the
fastnesses of Pelion, she wrestled with a lion, he became enamoured
of her. Counselled by Chiron, he carried her off in a
golden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span> chariot into
Libya. They were there kindly received by Venus, their nuptials
were celebrated, and the god gave her the country as a kingdom. Of
the other fables which connect the origin of Cyrene with the gods
of Greece; of the Grecian Hercules, who wrestled and overthrew
Antæus, the son of the Earth (the native Libyans); of the Garden of
the Hesperides, which bloomed with golden apples, inaccessible on
the western shore,—I need say nothing. The hidden meaning of the
myths, with which a patriotic religion was not long in enrolling
the obscure origin of a Grecian colony, perpetuates the story of
its early struggles, throwing a poetic gauze over facts too
humbling for its full-grown pride.</p>

<p>The new city was built on the table-land above the hill, from
whose side the fountain issues. The lofty walls which inclosed it,
and the temples and palaces which adorned it, arose a landmark for
the mariner. Seven descendants of its founder reigned in it
successively until about 450 <span class="sc2">B.C.</span>,
probably invested with a sort of patriarchal authority, such as the
early kings of Athens exercised. This was followed by a hundred and
thirty years of liberty or licence, succeeded by a strict
monarchical government under the Egyptian Ptolemys, the last of
whose kings bequeathed his country to the Roman Senate.</p>

<p>The history, as it has come down to us, begins with<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span> a period of profound
obscurity, which clouds the reigns of Battus and his son
Arcesilaus. To the latter succeeded Battus II., Eudaimon, Felix the
Happy. His reign was the golden age of Cyrenæan tradition. Fresh
settlers from the mother country brought increased prosperity to
the colony. Their territory became too narrow for its inhabitants,
who, gradually spreading over the surrounding country, drove out
the Libyan nomads; and thus the foundations of a power were
securely laid, which soon gave (with the possession of a sea-port,
Apollonia) a new impulse to enterprise. Teuchira and Hesperides
were afterwards founded to the westward, and Barce—long the most
flourishing of the daughter-cities, and at one time the rival of
the metropolis—whose name is still perpetuated in the Turkish
province of Barka. The native nomads did not, however, relinquish
their pasture grounds without a struggle; they implored the
assistance of the Egyptian king Apries, and the surname of Happy
was, perhaps, earned at the fountain of Theste (Kubbeh?), where
Battus defeated his troops. The Libyans were now subdued; the
victors intermarried with the daughters of the soil; Greek genius
was not long in adopting some, at least, of the mythology of their
subjects; and thus a permanent dominion, supported by force,
consanguinity, and religion, was established by the conqueror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span>But it was not
long before the monarchy was weakened by the defection of the
brothers of Arcesilaus II., son of Battus Felix, who, retiring from
their brother’s capital, founded Barce, and soon formed around it
an independent territory, peopled, like the new city itself, for
the most part by Libyans. Civil discord now divided the colony, and
bloody feuds stained the royal house. The constitution, thus
undermined by popular tumults and by regal encroachments, or
weakness, threatened to involve in its ruin the material prosperity
of the colony. In this conjuncture, the Cyrenæans again applied to
the Pythian Oracle for advice, and Demonax, the Mantinean, was
deputed by the god to restore order; he gained the good-will of all
parties, and established new institutions, which greatly curtailed
the royal power, but which were maintained during the reign of the
third Battus. His son and successor, Arcesilaus III., not content
to follow in his father’s steps, and impatient of restraint, was
driven into exile by the insurrection which his arbitrary conduct
had aroused; but soon returning, with Samian reinforcements, he
repossessed himself of a power which he now used with uncurbed
barbarity.</p>

<p>Such was the situation of affairs, when the Persian conquest of
Egypt threatened to destroy the political independence of Cyrene.
The king, not daring to trust his disaffected subjects (after
promising tribute<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">[xv]</span> to
his new neighbour), retired to Barce, where he continued the
cruelties which had rendered him odious in his own dominions. He
and his father-in-law, the king of Barce, were soon afterwards
murdered. His mother fled to Egypt, and claimed the protection of
the Persian Suzerain, with whose troops returning she laid siege to
Barce, and savagely revenged the assassination of her son. Cyrene,
by timely concessions, escaped uninjured from the Persian raid.
Another Battus and a fourth Arcesilaus reigned in it with mingled
feebleness and severity; in their hands the royal power lost all
consideration, and on the death of the last, royalty was abolished.
A free republic, aristocratic rather than democratic, now took its
place, accompanied by all the party contests and all the civil
seditions of which the history of the mother-country shows so many
examples. To this unsettled condition of its government must be
ascribed the fact, that, notwithstanding its situation—equally
favourable to commerce as that of Carthage—and its infinitely more
fertile soil, Cyrene never, either in the arts of war or in the
arts of peace, rivalled the city of Dido. A love of turbulence and
feuds seems to have formed an essential feature of the Greek
character; all the efforts which, from time to time, were made by
her wiser citizens to introduce better order into the republic,
were vain. At last they applied to the divine<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</span> Plato, requesting him to furnish them
with a code of laws; and posterity regrets that he was too prudent
to compromise his reputation, by legislating for so turbulent a
community.</p>

<p>Alexander’s apparition in Egypt was followed by a treaty which
seemed to guarantee the independence of Cyrene; but after his death
intestine troubles and the solicitations of exiles (who, for
whatever cause expelled their country, are ever its worst enemies)
attracted armed bands into their fertile provinces. These marauders
seized the ports, twice besieged the capital, and filled the
country with rapine and ruin, which neither the aid of Carthage nor
of the Libyan nomads could stay. At last, one stronger than either
party, Ptolemy, who had succeeded to Alexander in Egypt, sent a
fleet and troops and re-established tranquillity, <span class=
"sc2">B.C.</span> 322—a service which he turned to his own profit,
so that Cyrene became thereafter for many years a province of
Egypt, under the name of Pentapolis.</p>

<p>Unaccustomed to a regular government, the turbulent Cyrenæans
bore the yoke impatiently. Revolt followed revolt, and the Egyptian
viceroy himself rebelled against his master. But these vain
attempts at forming an independent government only sunk the
Pentapolis in deeper misery. It was about the time that the first
Jewish colonies were introduced, in conformity with the general
policy of Ptolemy; and they<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xvii">[xvii]</span> soon became so numerous here, that, at
length, no other country besides Palestine, contained so many
individuals of their nation. Enjoying equal rights with the Greeks
and the special favour of the king, they formed in the end a fourth
order in the State, and were governed by municipal magistrates of
their own. That they had a separate synagogue at Jerusalem, we
learn from the Acts of the Apostles, vi. 9; and their frequent
mention in the New Testament proves how important a part of the
Jewish nation they constituted. They distinguished themselves under
Trajan by a rebellion, in which they exhibited great ferocity; this
rebellion was only suppressed after immense slaughter had taken
place on both sides.</p>

<p>The reign of the third Ptolemy was a remarkable era for Cyrene.
The original laws delivered by Demonax the Arcadian had been
retained (with what corruption or modifications we know not) up to
this time; but now, with the king’s consent, the people called in
two distinguished natives of Megalopolis in the same province,
Ecdemus and Demophanes—disciples of the philosopher Arcesilaus—to
revise them. These two, as the historian informs us, “restored the
public peace and the safety of the citizens.” The history of the
following years is generally obscure; but enough remains to show,
that this tranquillity was not of long duration, and tumults and
rebellions continued<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xviii">[xviii]</span> to weaken the country till Ptolemy
Apion, on his death, <span class="sc2">B.C.</span> 96, bequeathed
it to the Roman Senate. About twenty years later, after a vain
attempt had been made to leave it in the enjoyment of
self-government, it was merged into a Roman province in conjunction
with Crete. It was, perhaps, in his administration of this
quæstorship, that Vespasian first came in contact with the Jews. In
the division of the empire, it fell to the share of Constantinople,
and was exempt from none of the miseries which afflicted the
distant provinces of the empire in its decay. The subsequent
desolation of the country is described in the inflated eloquence of
his time by the rhetorician Synesius, the Platonist bishop of
Ptolemaïs, who, in espousing his church, refused to part with his
wife. The nomad tribes gradually regained the ascendancy, driving
out the more civilised inhabitants; and from the date of the Arab
occupation, which immediately followed the conquest of Egypt, we
hear no more of the Cyrenaica, excepting what is given of it in the
short notice, which Abulfida has inserted in his Geography, under
the head of Barka. It now forms the eastern part of the Turkish
pachalik of Tripoli, divided into two prefectures, Benghazi and
Derna, which are the only inhabited towns remaining in its whole
extent.</p>

<p>The sources of wealth which the Cyrenaica presented<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_xix">[xix]</span> were many and valuable. Its
trade with the interior of Africa, by way of Augila, furnished for
exportation ivory, gold, precious stones, ostrich feathers, and
slaves—the same products which the triennial caravan from Waday, at
the present day, brings to Benghazi. Judging, however, from the
accounts of the ancients, from the remains of the splendid
caravanserais which we meet with on this route, the trade must have
been conducted on a far greater scale than at the present time.
Pindar refers to the commercial navy of Cyrene, by means of which
an active commerce was carried on with the main land, the islands
of Greece, and the coasts of Asia Minor. Of the indigenous produce
of this country, the first in rank, both for value and utility, was
derived from the silphium, which yielded a gummy juice, the
laserpitium, esteemed by the ancients as a remedy for almost every
disease. So universal was its fame that it gave a common epithet to
the country; and the “Silphium of Battus” is used by Aristophanes
as a synonym for exceeding wealth. It was a government monopoly,
and in Rome was sold for an equal weight of silver. It is
mentioned, if I mistake not, among the treasures which Cæsar laid
hold of at the commencement of the civil wars. Theophrastus and
Pliny describe the method of its cultivation, though, from the
expressions used by other<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_xx">[xx]</span> authors, it seems to have grown wild in the
desert places; but, however obtained, it undoubtedly yielded a
large revenue to the country.</p>

<p>The olive flourished with remarkable fruitfulness in its soil;
and the immense tracts which are at the present day still covered
with it, proves how extensive its cultivation must once have been,
and how congenial to it is the soil in which, after ages of
neglect, it still flourishes. Its crops of grain were as abundant
as those of Mauritius and Sicily, and furnished large exports.
During four months of my stay in the country I ate ripe grapes, and
in one place I left the half-formed fruit hanging in rich clusters
from the vines; so true is the ancient description which, speaking
of the various climates of the Cyrenaica, says, that the harvest
lasted nine months, beginning in the low grounds, then ascending to
the table-lands, and ending in the hills. The flowers of the
Cyrenaica were also celebrated, and the ground is still enamelled
with a rich flora; the crocus officinalis furnished a considerable
article of export, and its roses yielded the finest attar distilled
for its Egyptian Queen. The honey almost vied with that of
Hymettus, and in some places it is still gathered by the Arabs, who
send it in presents to their distant friends. The herds and flocks
which Pindar celebrates are still the wealth of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</span> its nomad inhabitants. The
breed of horses was remarkable for fleetness and endurance; and the
war-chariots in which they were harnessed were as celebrated as the
skill of the drivers who conducted them.</p>

<p>But the ancients do not confine their praises to the natural
productions of the soil. Cyrene was fruitful, also, in men
distinguished in the arts and sciences. Architecture and the
engraving of precious stones were both carried to great perfection
by the Cyrenæans. Of their skill in painting and sculpture few
evidences have reached us. It was in the liberal arts that they
especially shone; and a long list might be produced of men of
letters and science who adorned their birthplace or spread its fame
in other lands. The poems of Callimachus, a Cyrenæan of noble
birth, prove that the noblest exercise of genius was not neglected.
But the brightest lustre is shed upon the African Doria by its
mathematicians, physicians, and philosophers. Eratosthenes, the
poet, philosopher, and geometer, may also be called the Father of
Geography. But all are eclipsed by the fame of Aristippus, his
daughter Arete, and her son Aristippus (the mother-taught), who
founded, and to the third generation sustained, the glory of the
Cyrenæan School of Philosophy—a rare, perhaps a singular instance
of such mental gifts descending, as it were, by
inheritance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</span> We
know the doctrines of this school only by the writings of its
adversaries; we are not, therefore, qualified to pronounce judgment
upon them. In the original teaching it seems rather to have been a
contradiction to the stoic and cynical doctrines, establishing
enjoyment as the chief end of man, allied to moral freedom—a
philosophical enjoyment, which consists in using all the good
things which Providence has showered upon us. This was a doctrine
not discordant with the habits and genius of the people with whom
it originated. If later disciples of this school contended that the
true philosophy of life consists in the pursuits of voluptuousness,
or, exaggerating even this doctrine, taught that virtue for itself
is despicable, that no Deity exists, and that, since pain cannot be
entirely avoided, life itself is detestable—we may regard such
aberrations as the declamatory sophistries of ill-regulated genius,
not as the real opinions of a school whose first teacher sat at the
feet of Socrates.</p>

<p>I shall conclude by mentioning the authors who in modern times
have called attention to this country. Our guide in all that
relates to its ancient condition is the learned Dane Thrige, who,
in his work “Res Cyrenensium,” has exhausted all the information
that the most ingenious acuteness could extract from the writers of
antiquity. Of modern observers, the first in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_xxiii">[xxiii]</span> point of time is Leo Africanus, who,
with naïve simplicity, describes the Desert of Barka as a hideous
waste, peopled only by barbarians sunk in the most abject poverty.
Early in the eighteenth century, Lemaire, quoted by Paul Lucas, was
sent to explore the ruins which it was reported to contain, by
Louis XIV. After him, Shaw and Bruce visited some parts of the
province; but the first work which treated in detail of its
antiquities was that of the French artist Pacho, whose untimely end
prevented his reaping the laurels which his enterprising genius had
planted. He may be regarded as the re-discoverer of the remains of
Greek civilisation in this part of Africa. The work which he
produced under incredible difficulties is remarkable among modern
books of travel as a monument of industry and daring; and I here
gratefully acknowledge the amount of enjoyment for which I was
indebted to it during my tour. To his name it is only just to add
that of Beechey, whose accounts and scientific labours have
deprived future authors of the right to intrude upon their readers
the results of geographical observations. The plans and map which
accompany his work are of great value. Two Italian travellers,
anterior in point of time to the last-mentioned, must not be
forgotten, viz. Della Cella, a Genoese physician, who in the suite
of the Bey of Benghazi, visited this country in 1819, and published
an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxiv">[xxiv]</span> account of his
travels, which, though not without merit, leave much to be desired
in accuracy; and a merchant Crevelli, whose meagre journal was
published by the French Society of Geography. The last of the few
travellers who have penetrated into these almost unknown regions is
Dr. Barth, on whose hazardous attempt to reach the central kingdoms
of Africa the eyes of Europe are now turned with equal hope and
admiration. May the desert which has devoured so many valuable
lives, spare his to the advancement of science and
civilisation!</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> journey which the
following pages describe had been for many years the object of my
wishes, although it was only in 1852 that I was able to put my
design in execution. The experience of several tours in Syria had
taught me the necessity of knowing the language of the country, for
the sake of personal safety, as well as for gaining information; I
therefore lost no opportunity of making myself acquainted with the
colloquial, which differs so much from the classical, Arabic. The
study of this language is, indeed, very difficult, but it has been
to me a most charming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>
employment, and I have never regretted the many long hours which I
have devoted to the acquisition of it. Before leaving Europe I had
carefully studied all that ancient or modern authors have written
upon the old Pentapolis; and I came to this country provided with
the necessary instruments for measuring heights and ascertaining
the positions of the several points I should visit. I do not,
however, pretend to write a book full of antiquarian lore or
geographical details—on this head, my predecessors have left little
to be gleaned. Thrige, in his “Res Cyrenensium,” offers an ample
repertory for those who are desirous of knowing every fact that
classical antiquity has handed down to us, concerning the ancient
wealth and arts of the Cyreneans; and Beechey has given, with the
utmost accuracy, the position of the principal points of interest.
Pacho gives us many interesting details in his work, though,
perhaps, he has too highly coloured his descriptions; his drawings
of the remaining ruins are full of errors. Pacho has the merit of
having alone traversed this country at a time when it required no
little enterprise to risk a passage through it. I disclaim all
merit on the score of enterprise or remarkable discoveries; and if
the narrative of my visit to this lovely region should induce
others of my countrymen to vary their Egyptian and Syrian tours by
a visit to the Pentapolis, the object of my ambition<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span> will be gained. I shall have
conferred upon them the benefit of calling their attention to this
forgotten land, and on the inhabitants the still greater advantage
of a more frequent contact with European civilisation. There is no
country, excepting Morocco, where the Moslem has so little felt the
influence of modern civilisation, or where his fanaticism is more
offensive. Here, we are still in the sixteenth century; the pages
of Shaw and other old travellers are recalled in our daily dealings
with the Arabs, whose most offensive characteristics are only
mitigated by the vicinity of Malta, and through a certain
traditionary fear of British power.</p>

<p>Without further preamble, I shall state that my point of
departure was Malta, from whence I sailed for Benghazi, now the
principal town in the district, and the seat of Government. I took
my passage on board a brigantine of 150 tons, the <em>Pace</em>,
the largest vessel which trades between Malta and Benghazi. The
depth of water in the small part of the ancient harbour, which is
not yet sanded up, admits no vessel which draws more than ten feet
of water; after September the passage is so insecure, that all
direct intercourse ceases, and letters then can only be conveyed
from Malta by Tripoli, whence there is a weekly courier who comes
in thirteen days. I stowed myself on the deck of the brigantine, in
a box ten feet by five, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_4">[4]</span> about three and a half high, which, when washed
and carpeted, formed no inconvenient cabin, and saved me in great
part from the attacks of those creeping and jumping
fellow-passengers from which no Mediterranean merchant-vessel is
free. Being well supplied with new books, I managed to kill time
pleasantly enough during the six days that the passage lasted. In
the evening, after sunset, I used to take a seat upon the deck, to
chat with the captain and the scrivano,—a sort of mate,—and thus
learnt from them all they could tell me of the trade between Europe
and the regency of Tripoli, and of the wonders of the unknown land
I was going to visit. In their gossip I sometimes caught a faint
echo of old Herodotus. I much enjoyed one of their stories, which
they told with the greatest gravity, assuring me that they had
heard it from the most respectable natives. In the interior of
Africa, beyond the black hills, is a race of people whose men are
dogs, their women being like those of other nations. The husbands
spend their days in hunting, and at night bring home to their wives
the game they have killed; these cook and eat the meat, and give
the bones to their dog-husbands. They were both intelligent men,
able to give a satisfactory account of their trade; but they made
no difficulty in believing this story, and other tales not less
marvellous. The profits of the trading vessels are principally made
on the return<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> voyage,
when the cargo consists of cattle for the consumption of the
island, and bales of coarse wool, which is principally destined for
Leghorn. Paper and glass from this place, plain and printed cottons
from England and Switzerland, with planks from Trieste, form nearly
all the imports to Benghazi. The approach to the town is not
promising; the long, flat line of sand, broken here and there by
groups of palm-trees, becomes visible only at a very short distance
from the shore. On nearing it, two insignificant white-washed
marābuts, and the castle—a square building, flanked with round
towers, standing on the sea-shore, and conspicuous only from its
whiteness—are the first objects which strike the eye. The town
itself is not seen until the traveller is close to it; it looks
like a large collection of mud huts, unrelieved by a single
minaret, or even by the dove-cots, which render many of the mud
villages on the Nile so picturesque. Closer inspection confirms
this first impression of the town. The houses are indeed built of
stone, badly cemented with crumbling lime; but in the whole town
not more than a dozen have the convenience of a room raised above
the ground-floor (ghorfa). They are built round an oblong court,
with no attempt at architectural ornament, the walls not exceeding
fourteen feet in height, and almost in no case are the rooms more
than ten feet in breadth, though frequently thirty<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> or forty feet long. They are
lighted from the door; and, in the better houses, one, or perhaps
two, rooms have the additional convenience of small windows, which
are closed by wooden shutters. The flooring is sometimes of
flag-stones, generally of mud; and the flat roofs, formed with the
undressed trunks of the juniper trees, laid side by side across the
walls, covered with mats and plaster, are not impervious to the
winter rains. This is no unfavourable account of the houses of
Benghazi; and when I add, that the streets, filled with loose
sea-sand, are kept tolerably clean—remarkably so for an Oriental
town—I have done ample justice to its merits. The water for
drinking is brought from wells at a distance, in barrels or skins;
and every house has in its court-yard a well of brackish water,
which in many places is found at a depth of six feet. There are
near the shore two public wells—one due to a former English
consul—which are used for watering the cattle, but the essential
luxury of a fountain, or the convenience of a walk where the sand
does not reach the ankles, has not been thought of. The sanitary
inspection, under a talented German doctor, is very strict, and in
some cases might, perhaps, be adopted with advantage at home. His
word is law in all such matters as cleaning the streets, or
removing nuisances; no meat can be exposed for sale in the market,
which has not been offered for his inspection<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_7">[7]</span> before going to the slaughter-house; no
burial takes place without his certificate, though he only examines
the body when death is suspected to result from plague or other
infectious disease. He has not only the right to examine the bodies
of females, but he can have them disinterred if buried without his
certificate. Proceedings so contrary to Moslem prejudice, and even
to Moslem law, afford perhaps the strongest proof that can be
adduced of the utter disregard which the powers at Constantinople
show to the religious laws of the Koran, as well as of the slavish
submission of the people to the Government.</p>

<p>The census just completed gives 1200 for the number of houses in
Benghazi, which, in this country, represents a population of 10,000
to 12,000 souls; the deaths in the last year were 333, and seem to
favour the higher number, but they were above the annual average,
in consequence of epidemic measles having carried off 57 children.
In general, Benghazi may be considered the most healthy town in
North Africa; neither fever nor dysentery are endemic here, nor is
any other form of disease frequent, except ophthalmia, the
prevalence of which may be ascribed to the general filthiness, and
to the habit which the people have at night of sleeping exposed on
the terraces, or in the damp court-yards. It is disgusting to see
the little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> children,
round whose inflamed eyes swarms of flies cluster, no one taking
the trouble to drive them away. The markets are abundantly supplied
with mutton; occasionally beef is offered for sale; but vegetables
and fruit are very rare, and, till the last six years, nothing but
onions were to be had. Though the sea abounds in excellent fish,
the quantity taken is very small. Wine, potatoes, and fruit are
sometimes to be had, brought from Malta or Canea, from whence the
European and wealthier Turkish residents obtain their few luxuries.
When I speak of wealth, it is in a comparative sense; probably no
one, either native or foreigner, has a capital of 4000<em>l</em>.;
but there is no absolute poverty among the people, for the
cultivation of the land is open to all, on paying a tax of
one-tenth of the produce; and, excepting the Morocco or Tunis
Hajji, who pass through on their way to Mecca, I have never seen a
beggar in Benghazi.</p>

<p>The government of the province is in the hands of a Bey,
sometimes sent from Constantinople, sometimes nominated by the
Pacha of Tripoli, to whom he is subordinate. Soliman Agha, the
present Kaimakan, formerly in a domestic situation in his
household, was long Kehin to the present Pacha of Tripoli (Izzet
Pacha), and by him was appointed to Benghazi. His inability to read
or write is considered no obstacle to his being an efficient
Governor of an extensive<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_9">[9]</span> district; and in the visits I paid him I must
acknowledge that he seemed to be well-informed regarding the
affairs of his government, and to have an excellent memory. The
object of such an appointment is, of course, that the Pacha may
have in Benghazi a dependant who will not interfere with his
peculations. The Kaimakan, or Bey, is assisted by a Medjlis, or
council, composed of the Cadi, Mufti, and some ten members chosen
from among the principal persons of the place; and his
consideration is sustained by part of a regiment which is stationed
here—the rest of it doing duty at the castles newly erected for the
purpose of keeping the Arabs of the interior in subjection. The
Consular body consists of an English Vice-Consul, a French Consular
Agent, and Vice-Consuls—or calling themselves such—for Tuscany and
Sardinia. All of them, excepting the Englishman, are merchants, and
it may be questioned if their action is consequently as independent
as it should be, when we remember the monetary transactions which
they have with the customs, which are here administered by the
local Government. I can personally bear testimony to the cordial
hospitality of the French Consular Agent, M. Brest, and of his
family; and to the unceasing attentions of M. Xerri, a young
Maltese merchant, whom I found acting as Vice-Consul in the interim
between the departure of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_10">[10]</span> last Consul and the arrival of his successor.
Although the climate of Benghazi is perfectly wholesome, I should
not recommend it to any one as a residence: there are few of the
necessaries, and none of the luxuries, of life to be found there;
above all, there is no kind of society. Its antiquities afford at
most two days’ employment. They consist of large squared blocks of
stone scattered along the sea-shore, foundations of ancient
buildings in the sea, between the reef, which probably formed the
old mole, and the shore, with a flight of steps at the extremity of
the former. The shore has sunk considerably in this part of the
coast, as the foundations of buildings now beneath the water
testify; and often, after a winter storm, gems and medals are
picked up on the beach. On the land side of the town, the sea has
also made an irruption, forming a shallow lake in winter, which
dries up in summer, and leaves the surface glittering with salt, if
the winds are not high: hence Benghazi may be said to be built on a
narrow tongue of sand. On the opposite side of this lake, the
summits of the hills to the south-east of the town are covered with
old tombs, many of which are rifled, but not a few still yield
vases and stalactites of <i>terra cotta</i>. It was from here that
M. de Bourville obtained the splendid Panathenaic vases which adorn
the Museum of the Louvre; but such good fortune is hardly to be
looked for again. The existence of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_11">[11]</span> the tombs is not indicated by monuments or
other external marks,—a circumstance to which, perhaps, they owe
their preservation. Some are grottoes cut in the rock, beneath its
surface, and have long been sanded up; the more common are
rectangular excavations, about five feet by two feet, cut in the
rock, and covered by rough flattish stones. These also are always
found completely choked with sand; they contain vases generally of
a coarse quality, really fine vases being rare. The statuettes are,
generally, much more beautiful; and nothing can exceed the grace of
some which I saw in Paris, derived from M. de Bourville’s
collection. Though this country is named by ancient writers as
famed for its engravers, I have not seen a single fine intaglio or
cameo found here.</p>

<p>The modern costume of the Benghazini is simple, but not
ungraceful, and, like that of all countries which have not yet
adopted the tight-fitting fashions of Europe, is admirably adapted
to the climate. The red cap (tarboush or takyeh), with which a
cotton skull-cap (ma’raka) is generally worn, without the turban.
The under-garment consists of blue or white cotton drawers
(serwàl), generally reaching to the ankles, and rather tight from
the knee, exactly like those which one sees on the Roman statues of
barbarian prisoners; a shirt, with wide sleeves (sourieh), and a
waistcoat without sleeves (fermleh), or with sleeves
(reboun),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span> but this is
not always worn. A long, narrow, woollen sash (hhezàm) is wound
several times round the body, and the whole is covered by the
barracan (jerd), the simplest and most graceful, as it probably was
the earliest, article of dress ever invented. It is of white or
gray, sometimes of red wool, heavy or light, according to the
season; very like the Scotch plaid, though rather longer, but
differently worn. One corner is looped to the edge, about a yard
and a half from the end; the right arm and head are passed through
the aperture thus formed, the loop resting on the left shoulder;
the long end is next passed under the left elbow, and is then
thrown across the right arm and shoulder. This is the usual way of
wearing it in the town; but in the country, or where exposed to the
sun, a part of the breadth is passed over the head, and the end is
brought over the left shoulder in front. Thus worn, it is exactly
the costume of the antique statue of the sacrificator, which one
sees in many museums. The apparent cleanliness of this costume,
entirely white in summer, and its graceful folds, render it one of
the most elegant I have ever seen. These barracans are, for the
most part, the manufacture of Jerbel, in the regency of Tunis, and
the finer have stripes of silk interwoven in the breadth. Socks or
stockings (to complete my fashions of Benghazi) are seldom seen;
the yellow under-shoe (mest) more frequently. There are<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> three kinds of slippers worn:
the red Egyptian (markoub); a yellow slipper, with no heel, and a
red shoe, which leaves the instep quite uncovered, both called
sebàt.</p>

<p>The barracan forms, also, the principal dress of the women; but
they wear it in a different way, making a petticoat of it, and a
bag behind, in which they carry their children, or any other
<i>impedimenta</i> they may have; and they bring it in such a way
over the face as to form a very effectual veil. I have seen none on
whom this dress sat gracefully, and all seem frightfully dirty.
Some of the children whom one sees rolling naked in the sand of the
street would, if washed, be pretty, but the filth in which they are
reared soon destroys all vestige of good looks. Both women and
children wear immense hoop ear-rings, three and four inches in
diameter, and sometimes four or five in each ear, inserted one
above the other in the cartilage. The silver bracelets and anklets
which complete their adornment are sometimes of great weight. A
Jewess in Benghazi wears a pair of anklets which weigh five
pounds.</p>

<p>The flies form a remarkable feature, which must not be omitted
in describing Benghazi. None of the plagues of Egypt could exceed
them, and they often during the day render writing, or any
occupation which does not leave one hand free for the fan, utterly
impossible. They exist in myriads; hence, the Turks
call<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> Benghazi the fly
kingdom; and the flies by their pertinacity and voracity evidently
show that this is their own opinion. Nothing but continual fanning
can keep them off; even the musquitoe-net being unavailing against
plagues which creep as well as fly. When very thirsty they draw
blood, even through one’s stockings, their bite resembling the
sharp pricking of a leech; and wafers left upon a table entirely
disappear under their attacks in a very short time. In the evening,
if disturbed on the curtains, they rise in hundreds, making a
rushing noise like pheasants when a well-stocked cover is beaten.
In addition to the plague of flies, the shrill trumpet of
musquitoes keeps one constantly on the <i>qui vive</i>, but their
bite is not venomous like that of the musquitoes of Syria, Egypt,
or even Italy; and it is rather the association of ideas which
renders them harassing, than any actual injury they inflict. Other
insects, though not unknown, are seldom seen, or with a little care
may be entirely avoided. The first day I was in Benghazi my servant
killed a tarantula, a hideous, rough-backed, flat-headed lizard, in
the room I was put up in; but I have not seen a second. Nor have I
met with any scorpions, though they are sometimes found; their bite
is hardly to be called venomous. So insensible is the Arab
epidermis to pain, that a native hardly takes the trouble to apply
even a little butter or honey to the wound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>Scarcely any
trades, beyond those of the most necessary description, are
exercised at Benghazi. The French Consul, during my stay there, was
unable to have a pane of glass put into a window; the Tunisian who
formerly performed such feats having allowed himself to die. The
glass was there, but no one could cut it to the size of the window.
There are Jews here, into whose hands most of the less laborious
trades have fallen, as is usual in all countries, especially in the
East. They can sew a covering for your divan, or make up the
cushions; they will repair, in a certain fashion, any article of
silver or gold, or make you a saddle-cloth, or a sabre belt. They
are ready to turn their hands to anything; but after showing
themselves serviceable as may be, ask prices equal to about ten
times what would be demanded in Bond Street. A few days before
starting for the interior, I wished to have some balls cast, and I
soon saw the same Jews at work who a few days before had come to
repair a silver nargilih, which had passed through an Arab
servant’s hands. They worked in the court of my house; the casting
of balls being a highly prohibited operation. I was amused at the
way in which they set to work. Two commenced, but before the end of
the performance a third came to their aid, and then two more,
apparently to lighten the labour by the charms of their
conversation. My Jews sat down opposite to each<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> other, and scraped a hole in the
ground between them. In this they placed some lead, and covered it
with charcoal, which they soon blew into a bright heat by means of
a pair of bellows made of an entire goat’s skin, one end of which
was fitted with a nozzle, while the edges of the other extremity
were sewed to two flat sticks, so as to open or close by the
pressure of the hand. The lead was now melted, and to extract it
from its primitive crucible a little bit of tin, which was lying on
the ground, the lining of an old packing-case, was slipped and
fashioned into something like the bowl of a ladle, and this, held
by a pair of pincers, was all the apparatus required. It was highly
simple, but the quantity of wood and charcoal consumed was
enormous, and it took nearly five hours to cast little more than a
hundred balls. It must be confessed, in favour of the Jews, that if
their filth and ignorance equal those of their brethren in all
these countries, they are not behind them in industry. They are the
only hard workers in the place: other tradesmen, whether Moslem or
Maltese, seeming utterly indifferent to obtaining custom. I
required a framework for a divan, and the Maltese carpenter whom I
had sent for, after keeping me two days waiting, send word on the
Monday that he would come next week. I therefore found a couple of
Jews, who knocked together a very creditable divan in two hours.
One of the community, who by a series<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_17">[17]</span> of most ingenious manœuvres has contrived to
obtain English protection, and is now broker to the Vice-Consulate,
was hardly ever out of my house during my stay in Benghazi. His
voice was generally the first I heard in full exercise about
sunrise, and from time to time during the entire day, his tongue
seemed never to tire of discharging bad Arabic and worse Italian.
Such cleverness, such industry, never were employed for smaller
ends, for his profits must be inconsiderable. He knows, I believe,
every article in every house in the town, as well as if he had
taken an inventory of their contents, and when he pronounces some
longed-for object unattainable, it is certain that neither money,
diplomacy, nor address have been able to discover its
existence.</p>

<p>There is nothing to be said of the domestic habits of the Moslem
inhabitants. Their life is less luxurious, their feasts are less
frequent and less gay than those of richer places; they have few or
no amusements, and there is no bath in the town, excepting in the
castle, where there is one capable of containing a single person. I
have nowhere seen Moslemin so dirty in person.</p>

an Arab is. — Mode of Travelling. — Retinue. — Silphium. — Tombs. —

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">I was</span> detained in Benghazi
much longer than I could have wished by the non-arrival of a vessel
containing a part of my luggage, and by the beginning of Ramadhan,
during which time it is next to impossible to travel.</p>

<p>Servants who are fasting all day cannot be expected to be much
inclined for exertion, and as at night they sit up to gossip, or to
sing, waiting till it is time to take the last meal before the
dawn, it is hopeless in a tent to look for sleep. I made up my
mind, therefore, to wait till this month was over, and gave orders
for a start on the morrow of the Bairam. This, however, happened to
be Wednesday, and my guide represented to me that Wednesday is the
most unlucky of days to start on a journey, and the argument was
too sound for me to think of opposing it. Thursday afternoon was,
therefore, fixed on, but so little notion have the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> Arabs of punctuality, and so
little are Arab servants of use in preparing for a journey, that
everything had to be done by my European servant, and it was
Saturday morning before I left the town. An Arab merchant, who was
frequently in the habit of visiting me, gave me, however, some
consolation for the delay, by explaining that the seventh is the
luckiest day in the month, and as Saturday was the seventh, I had
only gained by the change of day. This is, perhaps, the place to
describe my equipment for the journey, and my companions. I bought
two wretched horses for myself and servant, hired a quick stepping
camel to carry a light tent, carpets, and other articles required
during the day (which was ridden by a young Arab servant, who acts
as coffee-maker and pipe-filler), and other camels for carrying the
rest of the baggage, including a larger tent, crowbars and pickaxes
for excavations, with water-skins and barley for six days for the
horses. My guide, an immense man, one Mohammed El Adouly, provided
his own horse, rather a showy white mare, and one of the best I had
seen in the country; mounted upon this, and enveloped in his white
barracan, new yellow and red shoes on his feet, which rested in the
broad shovel-shaped brass stirrups; his long gun slung over his
shoulders, with a blunderbuss at his saddle bow; a pair of pistols
slung under the left arm, and a Koran and a white bundle of
talismans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> under the
right—he presented a very majestic figure, and evidently thought so
himself. He was recommended to me as an indispensable guide for
such a journey, as he is well known to all the Bedawin in the
country, and his last wife was from the neighbourhood of Grennah;
he had accompanied M. de Bourville and one or two English
Vice-Consuls in their excursions through this country. I am, in
general, averse to taking into my service such necessary
personages, as they invariably endeavour to become the masters; but
as the written information concerning the places I was to visit is
very scanty, and no trust can be placed in the oral communication
of the natives, I submitted to the infliction. I was determined,
however, to have my own way, in which I succeeded very well,
retrenching myself in my English coldness, while listening to his
reasons why I should not do as I proposed, and then simply
repeating the order; this being somewhat the Turkish fashion, he
soon understood my method, and for some time obeyed my orders
without opposition. In addition to Mohammed and the pipe-boy, I had
with me a tall thin man, who fancied himself a cook, and an
inexpressibly dirty fellow who was to groom the horses, and also
make himself generally useful. The breed of horses in the
Pentapolitan is sadly degenerated from its renown in former times;
they are small and ill made, with no appearance of Arab blood; but
there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> are a few in
the interior which have great powers of endurance. My servant’s
horse, of the Dongola breed, which had been reduced to a skeleton
by a thirty-five days’ journey, during which his only food was what
he could pick up on the road, promises to turn out a better horse
than is usually met with in the country; he delights me by the very
knowing look, which he owes to his ears being slit at the top—a
sign that he was foaled at night.</p>

<p>After much screaming and scolding among the drivers, and the
usual amount of growling on the part of the camels, everything was
got into marching order, and, accompanied by some of my
acquaintance, who escorted me for an hour out of the town, I
quitted Benghazi. We stopped in about an hour and a half to fill
the water-skins, at a deep well of cool and sweet water, as we were
to find none till the next day, at Labiar. Our route was in a
south-easterly direction, across the hills, which bound the plain
of Benghazi, and while my luggage made directly for the spot where
we were to spend the night, I made a long <i>détour</i> to visit a
ruin called Kasa Tawileh, through an uninteresting country, and
without finding anything to reward my exertion. At about six hours
and a half from Benghazi we reached the foot of the hills, and
entered a beautiful ravine clothed with bushes and underwood; here
we saw some coveys of partridges,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_22">[22]</span> a few hares, and flights of wood-pigeons; but
the Arabs galloping about frightened them, so that it was
impossible to get a shot. They never think of firing except when
the game is on the ground, having never dreamt of a flying shot;
but their flint-locks generally missing fire, their poaching does
not do much harm to the game. We slept in an open space towards the
end of the ravine. The hills around it are called Bu Miriam, and
from them we descended the next morning to the great plain called
Ghat-es-Sultan, which stretches away to the right; we crossed it in
a south-east direction to Labiar. The country to the edge of the
hill, at the foot of which lies the valley of Labiar, is covered
with low underwood, juniper trees occasionally rising amidst
it.</p>

<p>From Benghazi to Labiar is fourteen hours of camel
travelling.</p>

<p>Labiar presents a strange appearance; a marābut on a slight
eminence looks down upon a long stony vale, in which are several
wells, but not a trace of vegetation. These were surrounded by
Bedawin busily employed in drawing water in goat-skins, while their
flocks and herds covered the bare rocky sides of the surrounding
hills, patiently waiting their turn to approach the watering-place.
From constant agitation the water in these wells is always muddy,
and even of this the cattle only have a drink once in
two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> or three days, as
many are driven from pasture grounds at a great distance. Here we
were visited by hosts of Bedawin, who formed a circle round the
small daytent in which I was resting until the camels should come
up. Nothing was to be learned from their conversation, but they
left behind them many lively reminiscences of their visit, and as
this was the case every time a Bedawy visited me, I soon came to
the resolution of forbidding their reception. The genuine Bedawy,
of this country at least, is one of the dirtiest animals on the
earth; their dress is often nothing but a brown barracan, which is
a mass of rags, and a dirty, very dirty, skull-cap. There is one of
them in this neighbourhood, who boasts of not having used water for
forty years, and it is only rarely that any of them make external
use of this precious commodity. The sheikh of Labiar brought me a
small skin of milk, and I bought of him a sheep for the evening’s
meal, which he made me pay dear for, though he refused money for
his milk, as to take money for it would be, as he said, (’aib,) “a
shame.”</p>

<p>Beyond Labiar, the country becomes less barren, being covered
with short grass, which, even when quite dry, has a greenish yellow
tone; it is thickly dotted with thorny plants, some of which were
just bursting into fresh leaf, and were most gaily green.</p>

<p>In four and a half hours from Labiar, our route<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span> taking a direction east by
north, we reached Sanct Bella Ghür, where we stopped near a well
ill supplied with water. From this vast plain five hours’
travelling over a beautiful range of hills called Jebel Fawaid,
through gorges clothed with the juniper—here almost a stately
tree—brought us to the wells of Elbenish, which presented a very
similar appearance to those of Labiar, though the country round the
Wadi, in which they lie, is less bare. While my tent was being
pitched for the mid-day repose, I rode to a distance of twenty
minutes to the north to see the remains of a ruined castle, called
by the Arabs Kasr Jbilla. It is a square building, with towers at
the corners, built of oblong blocks of wrought stone, of which, in
some parts, several courses still exist, devoid of ornament; it may
belong to Roman, or still earlier times. Placed on the summit of a
conical hill, it commands an extensive view, and may have been
destined to serve as a place of refuge from the attacks of the
nomad tribes. With every care I could discover no trace of the
inscriptions of which Della Cella speaks, and am inclined to think
he mistook for characters the effect of the weather on the worn
surface of the stones. The Arabs of the neighbourhood (they are
Anaghir) bury their dead round the walls, and I saw several recent
graves.</p>

<p>From Elbenich we entered the Jebel el Abid, inhabited by Arabs
of the same name, and in four hours<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_25">[25]</span> reached Zardes, where we slept, keeping,
however, a good watch, as the Abid have a villanous reputation for
thieving, and during the night gave us more than one <i>alerte</i>.
Zardes is a valley containing wells, and surrounded by hills, in
the protruding summits of which are many crevices, wherein grow the
juniper and wild thyme, whose perfume fills the air; the ground
around glittering with white flowers. This country, towards
evening, when a pink tinge covers it, reminded me frequently of a
Scotch moor. The next day was a fatiguing one; there being no
suitable place for resting in the middle of the journey, I rode six
hours before I halted my party. I generally left the camels with my
servant, to prevent loitering, and rode on ahead with a guide and
some Arab attendants. At the leisurely pace of an Arab traveller I
gained upon the luggage fifteen or twenty minutes in every hour. I
have noted the distances, for convenience’ sake, by the times of
the departure and arrival of the camels, (at which I was always
present,) their pace being uniform. I rode on or loitered on the
road. Mohammed, in all his magnificence, led the way; the servants,
equally well armed, being generally with him, and any chance
traveller who might have joined the caravan; I usually followed a
little in the rear. My guide and the other Arabs from time to time
solaced themselves with song. They have two<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_26">[26]</span> unmusical and strange, which is
remarkable, as the music of the countries on either side—Egypt and
Tunis—is very pretty. The leader sings a couple of lines, which he
constantly repeats with slight variations, while the rest join in a
strange howling chorus. The verse is generally extempore,
containing little rhyme and still less reason, and the best idea I
can give of its import and style is by recalling the nursery
ditty,—</p>

<div class="linegrp-container">
<div class="linegrp">
<div class="group">
<div class="line indent0">Here we go up, up, up,</div>

<div class="line indent0">Now we go down, down.</div>
</div>

<div class="group">
<div class="line indent2"><em>Chorus</em>—How, wow, how.</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="nind">as like bow wow wow as can be.</p>

<p>In leaving Zardes our road lay for three hours over hills
covered with large junipers and other trees of the cypress tribe.
This species of juniper is indigenous to the Cyrenaica; it is the
<i>Thuya</i> of Pliny, and though it now only furnishes the small
rough beams of which the roofing of the Benghazi houses is formed,
it was in ancient times extensively used in upholstery, and
furnished the precious citrian tables to the luxury of Greece and
Rome. The wood has a bright yellow colour, and might, I should
think, become again fashionable if introduced into Europe.<a id=
"FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>We now came to an
extensive plain called El-Hhiah, and further on to Sharb Tawalun,
which was entirely burnt up, though the camels still found ample
amusement, as they stragglingly loitered along, in plucking on this
side and on that the half-dried tufts of thorny shrubs with which
it is overgrown. Merawah, eleven hours distant, was our next
halting-place; near it we started numbers of gazelles, which I
could not get within shot of, though I had murdering intentions,
our stock of provisions being very low. Here the camel drivers were
busy, all the evening, preparing muzzles for the camels, to prevent
them eating the <i>Driâs</i>, with which the country between here
and Cyrene is covered. Most authors consider this plant to be the
old <i>Silphium</i>, though its medicinal virtues are forgotten,
and it is only known as the dreaded poison which threatens the
lives of camels which are not reared in this tract of country. It
is from no partiality for its flavour that they eat it, for they
refuse it when offered to them. They crop it as they pass along,
tempted by the long stem, which brings it so near their noses. It
is at the present season, when in seed, that it is considered most
deadly; I am told that in spring it is unnecessary to take
precautions against it. If not the real <i>Silphium</i>, it
certainly answers to the description given<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_28">[28]</span> of the plant by Theophrastus, and I cannot
think the objection to its identity urged by the learned M.
Duchalais, from the form of the seed on the medals, is of much
weight. I have seen seeds which nearly enough resemble the
<i>Magydaris</i> on the medals, though they certainly are not
heart-shaped, but the plant itself, as represented on them, is
evidently what Mr. Pugin would call a conventional Silphium, for no
plant of this species has the stem so thick in proportion to its
height and flower. The seeds are highly medicinal, but I was
unfortunately too late to ascertain if it yields a juice
corresponding to the ancient Opos.</p>

<p>The next day our travelling from Merawah to Sireh, nine hours,
and thence to Slŭnt, two hours, was very slow, for the camels, with
their mouths tied up, were in a very bad humour, and could hardly
be made to move. The appearance of the country was now varied by a
number of caroub trees, which, contrasted with the duller juniper,
looked of a bright green, and afforded a most grateful shade.
Half-way between Merawah and Sireh is a large reservoir of ancient
construction. It had been supported on six columns, and in many
places the cement still adheres to the walls. There being no well
in this neighbourhood, it was constructed to collect the rain-water
from the hill at whose base it lies; its presence denotes, I
presume, the site of some old town or village; but I
observed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> no other
remains of antiquity in its neighbourhood. It is true that the
morning was very hot, and I, perhaps, gave myself little trouble in
looking for them.<a id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2"
class="fnanchor">[2]</a> At Sireh are remains of a square castle,
like that which I visited at Elbenich, but not so well preserved
nor in so commanding a situation. Many similar remains of castles,
which probably formed a line of defence against the border tribes,
are to be seen on the summits of the hills. In the face of the
rocks at Sireh are many excavations, devoid of ornament, and
evidently intended as sepulchres, though the Arabs, of course,
assert that they were the abodes of the ancient inhabitants. At
Slŭnt the rock is burrowed with such excavations, each with a
fore-court cut in the rock, having one or three entrances to the
sepulchral chambers, some of which are most extensive, and
supported by rude columns. I found one occupied by Arab ladies, who
did not welcome my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
visit; probably thinking I had sinister intentions on their grain,
for which it served as a magazine. It was certainly from no
Oriental idea of the sacredness of the Hareem that they seemed so
relieved when I turned my horse’s head. The Bedawin women, dirty
and tattooed, have no difficulty in showing their bare faces to
strangers; and, notwithstanding the stories of Herodotus, I think
there is no risk in their doing so. They wear leather leggings up
to the knee; in other respects their dress differs little, except
in its darker colour, from that of the Benghazi women.</p>

<p>The next morning a ride of two hours and a quarter through an
interesting country brought us to the Marābut Sidi Mohammed el
Himary, where there is an ill-supplied well, and a rock, under
which a shade may be obtained without the trouble of pitching a
tent. Barth, I think, gives this as the site of the ancient
Balaerai, whose distance was twelve miles from Cyrene; but it took
my camels seven hours and a half from here to Grennah, which, at
the slowest rate of travelling, must give fifteen miles, and from
the length of time I was on horseback I should judge the distance
nearer eighteen. The ride from here to Grennah is worth a journey
from Europe. About half-way, after passing through a valley
containing many splendid old junipers, under which goats, flocked
together, were enjoying the shade, we came to a spring of
living<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span> water, called
Menezzah Wad Fairyeh. The rest of the journey was over a range of
low undulating hills, offering, perhaps, the most lovely sylvan
scenery in the world. The country is like a most beautifully
arranged <i>Jardin Anglais</i>, covered with pyramidal clumps of
evergreens, variously disposed, as if by the hand of the most
refined taste; while <i>bosquets</i> of junipers and cedars,
relieved by the pale olive and the bright green of the tall arbutus
tree, afford a most grateful shade from the mid-day sun. In one of
these bowers I had my carpet spread for luncheon; some singing
birds joined their voices to the lively chirping of the
grasshoppers, and around fluttered many a gaily-painted butterfly.
The old capital of the Pentapolis was before me, yet I was strongly
tempted to pitch my tent for a time in this fairy scene.</p>

<p>Whoever has traversed these fresh groves in the parching heat of
an African July can understand the enthusiastic praises of the
older writers, and why the Arabs, coming from the Desert, called
the country the Green Mountain. As we approached Cyrene, this
exuberant vegetation disappeared, and in its place we passed
through long avenues of tombs, hewn in the rock, or out of it; next
we came in sight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> of
the ruined towers of the old city walls; and then, through a long
line of ruins, we reached the street of Battus, where a narrow
gorge opens upon a magnificent view over plains and hills to the
blue Mediterranean. I rode on to the cave whence gushes the
perennial spring of Cyre, took a draught of its bright, cool water,
and fixed my temporary home beneath the world-famed fountain,
amidst the countless ruins of temples and public buildings.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">My</span> first day in Grennah was
entirely occupied in the very matter of fact, but not less
necessary, employment of arranging my encampment, whilst Mohammed
was equally busy in receiving the visits of his Arab friends, in
whose society he entirely forgot me; he seemed to imagine that he
was making a tour of pleasure with the Frank in his suite, not that
he was in the service of the Frank. He took possession of the
Grotto of the Fountain, and established himself on sundry mats and
carpets in a part which is now dry. I also went there for shelter
from the hot sun, while my larger tent was being prepared; and sat
by the bubbling water, out of reach of the Bedawin and their fleas,
but close enough to hear the Babel-screaming of their<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> conversation, and to be amused
by its monotony. The Arabs are great talkers, but the range of
their ideas is remarkably limited, so that the day is often passed
in an unceasing repetition of the same words. I noted down such a
conversation, and, as a favourable specimen of <i>causerie</i>, I
transcribe it here. There arrived a gray-bearded old Bedawy, with a
long gun, and pistols in his belt, but in all other respects a
striking contrast to the city <em>brave</em> whom he had come to
see. As he came up, he pronounced, “Es-selam alaik” (“Peace be with
you”); receiving a long, drawling answer, “Alaik es-selam” (“With
you be peace”). He then went up to Mohammed, and touched his right
hand, whereon each kissed the palm of his own hand; he then
literally fell on Mohammed’s neck, and kissed it on the right side,
just below the whisker—a salute which was immediately returned. Now
began a rolling fire of questions and answers, in such quick
succession, that it required a practised ear to follow their
meaning; neither party seeming to pay attention to question or
answer—both being already, no doubt, aware of their import. After
repeating the words, “Es-selam,” several times, then came the
inquiry, “How is your state? How are you? How is your humour?” The
answer was, “May your state be peaceful;” or “Praise be to God;”—an
answer, generally, given only to very pointed inquiries after
health.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span> These
questions were repeated three or four times. Then again, “Es-selam,
How is your state? how is your humour? how is the state behind
you?”—meaning the family left at home. Again, “Es-selam, How is
your state? how is the state of your house (wife)?” Again,
“Es-selam, How is the state of your children?” and so continually
with the same words, varying the final interrogatory by asking
after his brother, and his mare, and his cows, and his sheep,—in
fine, after all things that are his, down to the most insignificant
of his possessions; each being the object of a particular inquiry.
Next came the gist of the conversation—half an hour having been,
perhaps, thus passed in preliminaries—which affected the value of
the inquirer’s own possessions, for the child of Nature has a keen
eye to business. “What is the price of corn in Benghazi?”—then a
string of salams. Presently he asks what barley is selling at, and
then follow renewed inquiries after his friend’s state and humour;
as if the fatigue of answering so many questions may have altered
them. When reassured on this point, he slips in an inquiry, “How
much do oxen fetch?” and if he be a keen politician he next attacks
the local news: “Why has the Pacha come to Benghazi?” “Is the Bey
going to be dismissed?” “Is it true that there is war with the
French in Tripoli?” and so on he questions; but the great point of
interest is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> state
of the markets. Such conversations to one who has nothing to buy or
sell, are naturally rather monotonous; and their charm was not
sufficient to overcome my dread of the various parasites which
constantly lurk under an Arab barracan. Had I not at once
determined upon excluding the Bedawin from my tent, I should have
sacrificed every moment of study or quiet. A visit of three hours’
duration is not a long one for an Arab, though the greater part is
sometimes passed in silence, after the first torrent of words has
burst forth; and on seeing a cool, well-carpeted tent, few of the
tribe would make any scruple, if once admitted, of stretching
themselves out, and sleeping through the heat of the day.</p>

<p>Having settled myself comfortably in a delightful position, I
now set about taking a general view of the ruins; and I soon found
that, to obtain any true notion of the details, I must form a plan
for visiting, in some kind of order, the vast labyrinth which lay
before me. There are many miles of Necropolis, extending all round
the city; and, in some places, the monuments and sarcophagi rise in
terraces of ten, and even twelve rows, one above the other. The
ruins of the town itself are in such a state of dilapidation, that
it would require no little study to obtain a satisfactory idea of
their nature; there are few remains of private dwellings above
ground, and extensive excavations<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_37">[37]</span> would be required to uncover them. The
excavator would doubtless reap a rich harvest, particularly of
medals and, perhaps, of other small works of art. Temples, public
buildings, and tombs, being more exposed to violation, are less
likely than private dwellings to reward the excavator; in modern
times, however, none of the visitors who have excavated here have
applied themselves to clearing the houses, which would require
great perseverance and the expenditure of considerable funds. It is
almost impossible for an amateur traveller to attempt such
excavations; for they demand his continued presence on the spot, to
prevent the abstraction of the smaller objects which may be found,
and the wanton destruction of others; and the jealousy of the
natives, who regard him as a treasure-seeker, can only be
effectually repressed by the aid of the Government. I did not,
therefore, push my researches beyond the platform on which the
ancient agora stood, as, my tents being pitched there, it was easy
to watch the excavators.</p>

</figure>
</div>

<p>On arriving at Grennah, the first object which naturally
attracts the traveller’s attention, is the fountain of Cyre—the
cause which led to the choice of this site for building the city,
and, in the days of its prosperity, the spot round which most of
the public buildings were grouped. Though the volume of water which
it pours out has much diminished, even in the<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_38">[38]</span> memory of man, it is still the most
abundant spring in this neighbourhood; and flocks of sheep and
goats, and herds of cattle, daily cover the ground where once the
sacred rites of Apollo, or the affairs of their prosperous
commerce, assembled the citizens of Cyrene. The stream of water
issues from a natural passage, artificially widened; it falls into
a shallow, square reservoir, cut in the ground of the cave; and
hence it was formerly distributed, through a series of stone
channels, of which many fragments still remain. The external rock
is smoothed to receive the addition of a portico of that beautiful
white limestone, closer-grained than marble, which acquires in time
a warm golden hue. The line of the fronton, deeply cut in the rock,
shows the outline of its architecture, and the three lower courses
of masonry, its material. In the rock to the right is an
inscription, beautifully cut, recording a restoration of the
fountain, which, from its position, as well as its clear, simple
characters, may well be of earlier date than the first century,
which is generally assigned to it. In front of the fountain, two
massive walls support narrow platforms, the lower of which is
covered with the foundations of buildings, whose marble fragments
indicate considerable magnificence. Beneath these extends a broad
terrace, 700 feet in length, supported by a lofty and very massive
wall, which is still in great part entire. One end of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> this terrace is closed by a wall
of more recent construction, built apparently to shut out the old
Greek theatre, which lies beyond it; the other opens on the street
of Battus, and, in part, is bounded by a road running from this,
round the base of the eastern hill. On this platform, which formed
the agora, stood many temples and public buildings; and it is here
that the monument of Battus, mentioned by Pindar, as standing at
the end of the market-place, must be looked for. As one stands in
front of the fountain, looking to the sea, this platform, covered
with ruins, lies at one’s feet; while beyond, the long lines of the
Eastern Necropolis wind round the curves of the hills, and the
plain beneath is seen dotted with ruins, or intersected by old
roads. To the left, immediately beneath the fountain, are the
remains of a very large building, whose massive fragments of marble
cornices and columns indicate its importance, as well as its more
recent date. Among the rubbish lie fluted columns, the headless
statue of a sitting female figure, and some fragments of
inscriptions. No building in the agora seems to have equalled this
in size; and I believe that all my predecessors agree in
considering it to be the Temple of Apollo. To the left of this
building, behind, and almost touching it at one angle, is a temple
of more ancient construction, the lower parts of four of whose
columns still remain <i>in situ</i>. Still further to<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span> the left, is a small building,
in front of which some former excavator has uncovered a
finely-draped statue of a Roman empress, and on a marble near, is
an inscription, nearly defaced, belonging, perhaps, to its
pedestal. The arms and head, originally separate, have been
removed, as well as the, probably, metal girdle of the waist. I
continued the excavation round this monument, with no other result
than finding a coarse white mosaic pavement, and a long
subterranean passage, which seems to have been a sewer. Almost in a
line with this building, still to the left, and close to the
boundary-wall, is a monument of great interest. It is of massive
construction, and evidently of ancient date, and, in plan, bears a
strong resemblance to some of the finest monuments in the
Necropolis. Its situation, its size, its antiquity, leave no doubt
on my mind that this is the Heroon of Battus, whose monument was
erected in the market-place, while the kings, his successors,
reposed each in front of his own palace. I had the greater part of
the interior of this monument dug out, without finding anything but
a few fragments of bronze and ivory, of <i>terra cotta</i> of the
very oldest workmanship, and a part of an alabaster vase, of
remarkable thinness; but no inscription rewarded me, either by
confirming my conjecture, or by assigning another origin to the
monument. Whilst digging here, the excavators were interrupted by
some Bedawin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span> who
came to prevent my further researches in the ruins; but, as they
were armed, and seemed half inclined to violence, and were very
impertinent, I refused to listen to them. I told them that the land
was the Sultan’s—a proposition which they did not controvert; and
then I asked if they, or their fathers, had either built or bought
“the castle.” My argument might be bad, but added to a resolute
countenance, it was good enough to prevent any renewal of such
obstructions from the natives.</p>

<p>Turning to the right, we behold a vast mass of confused
substructures, the ground plan of a very large collection of
buildings, though it would be difficult to assign to them a name.
One very large chamber, near the edge of the platform, I found, on
excavation, paved with a coating of the stucco used for reservoirs,
and beneath this a broken pavement of Cipollino marble. The
remaining parts of the building give no indication of its having
been a bath, and its position forbids the idea that it was a
reservoir. Further to the right are two other ruins, with arches
and columns of Cipollino and a coarse white marble. To the right,
the buildings advance to the edge of the platform, while in front
of the fountain, and to the left, there is a wide space between the
large masses of ruin and the well which supports the terrace. In
this there are few remains of old buildings, the ground<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span> having been long used by the
Bedawin as a cornfield; but the few fragments scattered here and
there render it probable that buildings were not wanting in this
direction; at least, such as would be required for the
accommodation of the assemblies of the citizens.</p>

<p>Proceeding along the platform, and crossing the wall which
closes it to the west, we come to the best preserved monument in
Cyrene, the old Greek theatre. Its form, nearly three-fourths of a
circle, occupied by seats, is almost perfect, but the proscenium
has disappeared. Some attempts which I made to discover the line of
the stage were fruitless, as they brought to light only loose
stones which had fallen from the wall above. The external wall is
still perfect, rising perpendicularly from the ground beneath in a
curve, and I am inclined to ascribe the disappearance of the stage
and its decorations to a very remote date. It seems, from the wall
which completely sequesters it from the agora, that this theatre,
notwithstanding its admirable position, must have fallen into
disuse, and been dismantled, for not a fragment of marble is to be
found in its circuit. Had the present ruin resulted only from the
barbarians, or from natural causes, there would have remained, at
least, blocks of marble, as in the other monuments of the town, but
none such would be found, if, as I conjecture, the ancients
themselves<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> removed
these decorations to use them in some one of the other theatres, of
which we shall find remains. I counted twenty-seven rows of seats,
and conjectured twelve or fourteen more buried under the ruins
fallen from above. I much regretted that the enormous masses of
these ruins made it impossible for me to attempt clearing the
interior, as no building of Cyrene is of a more interesting epoch,
and none so perfect; its form, also, is uncommon. It is built in
the side of the hill, and the rampart wall which supported the
stage is nearly forty feet high to the level of the orchestra. A
flight of steps from the top leads down to the orchestra; and there
seems also to have been an entrance on a level with it from the
east. Immediately beneath the theatre, on a lower terrace of the
hill, are the ruins of a large building, consisting of three very
perfect and beautifully proportioned arches, with a fourth at right
angles to them. In front of them is a large quadrangle now occupied
by a Bedawy, as garden ground, and beneath lie many remnants of
fluted columns in white marble, and their capitals, whose execution
is more pure and careful than that of any other fragments to be
found in the ruins. In Beechey’s plan this is noted as a temple,
and though, at first, I was inclined to regard it as a reservoir
for the waters of the fountain, which were in part carried in this
direction, I, on further<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_44">[44]</span> examination, found nothing to justify a
disagreement with so great an authority.</p>

<p>Leaving the fountain, we proceed in a southerly direction up the
ravine, which forms the street of Battus; on either side the hills
are steep, presenting surfaces of rock, in some of which tombs had
been evidently excavated; while to the right, although the rock has
been in many places smoothed away, or even hollowed, it is more
probable, from the remains of masonry, that the ground was occupied
by public or private buildings. The facility with which cellars and
magazines can be excavated in the soft limestone, of which the
hills are composed, would naturally be taken advantage of, for
increasing the accommodation of the private dwellings, and in two
instances, as I shall afterwards have occasion to mention, I found
unmistakable evidence of this. Where the ravine widens, to the
right above the road, are remains supposed to mark the site of the
temple of Juno, an inscription relating to the priestesses of the
goddess having been found here by Beechey; but the little that
remains of the temple presents nothing of peculiar interest, a
remark which, unfortunately, with few exceptions, is applicable to
almost all the ruins found within the circuit of the city. Above
this, on the summit of the western hill, is the corner of a
building, which, seen from below, looks like a tower,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span> and here the substructures are
very large, covering a great portion of the plateau. All this part
has been extensively excavated in certain directions, by order of
the Grand Vizier, who presented the spoil to France. Some small
statues in the best style of Greek art, I am told, were found here,
but I speak only on hearsay. There still remains a good cubical
altar of white marble, which the Arab labourers were obliged to
abandon on account of its weight; it having broken down the rude
carriage which they had constructed for its removal. On the four
sides are bas-reliefs, each representing a figure standing in a
quadriga; and when I first saw it there was on one side a votive
inscription, which it was difficult to decipher; unfortunately I
deferred copying it at the time, and on my return, some days
afterwards, I found that it had been defaced by the Arabs. They had
probably seen me stopping before and examining the inscription,
which was, I fear, with them, reason sufficient for its
destruction.</p>

<p>Proceeding up the street we reach the line of a large building,
marked by many fallen columns, and then we come to the well-defined
outline of a large theatre, once adorned with a colonnade of
marble; among the <i>débris</i> of which are many fragments of red
and gray granite, and some mutilated statues, once the decorations
of its proscenium. A flight of steps leads to<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_46">[46]</span> the orchestra from the rising ground
above. Further on is a large building also, with many fallen
columns, having in its north-west extremity an apsis of small
dimensions. It seems to have been a basilica, as its architecture
is too good to suppose that it was a Christian church. On the left
nothing but scattered formless heaps of stone are to be seen, until
after passing this building, when we reach a lofty tower, of which
one corner remains; extensive ruins also attract attention on
account of the numerous arches, not of the best construction, which
still show their curves above the encumbered ground. An apse,
having the same direction as that in the other building, is still
standing, and many marble columns strew the ground. This is marked
in Beechey’s plan as a church, a conjecture which the debased style
of architecture, as well as the general plan, fully justifies, and
which is, perhaps, confirmed by a stone which I turned up among the
ruins, on which a Greek cross is coarsely carved. On either side
are smaller heaps of ruins, and thence a grass-covered plain,
almost unmarked by any building, but once, perhaps, covered with
private dwellings, reaches to the city walls. Just beyond there is
a piece of ground covered with what seems to be gravestones, some
marked with the cross, and others with the double triangle,
commonly called Solomon’s Seal. This may be an old Jewish and
Christian burial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
ground, and the tradition of the Arabs points it out as the place
where the last battle was fought between the Christian inhabitants
and the Moslem invaders.</p>

<p>On riding up the eastern hill from the fountain, one finds it
formed of a series of terraces, partly natural and partly
artificial, with a broad plateau overlooking the street of Battus
on the summit. On one of these terraces, the form of the ground and
the beautiful site induced me at first to suppose some ruins I
found to be those of a theatre; but the ground in these hills so
often takes a semicircular form, and the remains of masonry were so
few, that, on further examination of the spot, I was inclined to
believe that the appearance was accidental. A winding road led from
the plateau to the agora, and steps cut in the rock afforded a
shorter cut for pedestrians. In the sides of the terraces are many
excavations, which, judging from the disposition of the interiors,
must have formed parts of private houses, and some of them, if
cleared out, would form commodious enough adjuncts to an
encampment. On the summit are the remains of several buildings, one
with five arches still appearing above the ground, and there are
others of not inconsiderable size. Further to the east are several
hillocks, two of them covered with the ruins of temples; one of
them, called by the Arabs Kasr’ Sharkyeh, is supposed by Barthe to
be the temple of Æsculapius,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_48">[48]</span> the treasury of the state. It is evidently of
early date, and still shows traces of the colonnade which
surrounded it. On a terrace below, a little to the north-west, a
small stream issues from a cave, most picturesquely overgrown with
maiden-hair and mosses; into this cave the water filtrates from
narrow rents in the rock. Here, as in all similar cases, the
industrious hand of man is visible; a second passage is cut in the
rock to increase the flow of water, but this is now dry, and one
narrow stream trickles only from the natural passage. In front
there are remains of a reservoir built to collect the water. From
this point, near which there are remains of a tower, the city walls
are distinctly traceable in a large circuit to the deep ravine,
which forms the boundary on the west. A group of rocks rising from
the soil near Kasr’ Sharkyeh seems to have been in some way
connected with the sanctuary, as they are cut into niches, small
chambers, and seats, and having been thrown from their original
position, probably by some natural convulsion, they now present a
most singular appearance of elfish disorder. Proceeding southwards,
and passing a small temple, whose longer axis runs perpendicularly
to that of Æsculapius, we see the stadium a little to the right.
Long parallel lines closed at one end by a curve, mark its form
most perfectly; in a few places the seats may be traced, but in the
long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> grass, which has
overgrown its area, I could find no traces of the spina or goals.
The city wall is, in its lower courses of masonry, well preserved
from a point immediately east of Kasr’ Sharkyeh, where it makes a
right angle, flanked with two square towers. Others succeed at
short intervals along the line which runs to the west, but they are
not placed at any regular distances; the rock in general forms the
lower course in the walls, and in one place it has been built into
it to a height of twelve feet, being cut away on both sides to the
thickness of the wall. This continues to run in a westerly
direction till it reaches a gigantic rectangular reservoir, of the
most solid construction, but apparently never finished. Three
massive arched conduits seem destined to distribute the water, and
the vastness of the design and solidity of the execution render it
worthy to be ranked with the greatest of the Roman aqueducts. In
the arches, where the cement has fallen away, are to be seen on the
stones letters deeply carved. They are the builders’ marks, and
here are all Greek characters, though the Φ lying on its side
(<img src='images/sym01.jpg' class="sym1" alt=
'[Theta-like symbol]'>), and the Ψ (<img src='images/sym02.jpg'
class="sym2" alt='[Psi-like symbol]'>) look strange. Among the most
frequent are <img src='images/sym03.jpg' class="sym1" alt=
'[Symbol sequence]'>. The stones were doubtless thus marked in the
quarry where they were cut in the curve of the arch, and the
characters appear in a certain symmetry.</p>

<p>The wall from this point continues to run westwards<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> for some space, then, turning
towards the north, it follows the edge of the western valley (Wady
Bil Ghadir) up to a point where the perpendicular rocks render no
artificial defence necessary, and here it terminates in a lofty
tower. Beyond it I remarked two small reservoirs; a building of a
large size, of the Roman epoch, having a central chamber terminated
in an apsis; and near this another, evidently a stronghold of
Byzantine, if not Arab, times. Many other smaller ruins lie beyond
the walls on this side; among them a small temple, with fallen
Ionic columns.</p>

<p>Without riding on to the tall tower which overhangs the steep
rock of the Wady, we turn to the right, entering the
strongly-fortified gate on the old Barca road. After passing the
indications of many small buildings, fragments of marble and
substructions, the most extensive ruin remaining in Cyrene presents
itself. This is an immense quadrangle, whose north-west side is
broken to inclose a small and very perfect theatre, which still
shows three of the five vaulted entrances which gave admittance to
its interior. The larger area, whose entrance gate is still entire,
is supposed to have been a forum of the Ptolemaic or Roman time.
Excavations have laid bare a number of small chambers and a
reservoir, along the eastern side, besides a large building in the
centre. No inscription<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_51">[51]</span> is at present visible; but there remains
enough of the old decorations to show that the interior and the
exterior, at least on the south-east, were decorated with
colonnades. Continuing down-hill, to re-enter the street of Battus,
we find, near the temple of Juno, another large monument, having
many columns, with marble capitals; this was probably a palace. On
the exterior of the north-east side are the remains of a series of
vaulted chambers, ingeniously conjectured to have been
coach-houses—a necessary convenience in the land of chariots.</p>

<p>There are very many small buildings to be traced on the sites I
have endeavoured to describe, but they are in general only
quadrangular foundations, in great part overgrown with grass; and
in our ignorance of those details of Cyrenean life or history,
which lend an interest to every spot in Athens and Rome, it would
be tedious and, in truth, impossible to particularise them. The
muse of history has not deigned to notice the vicissitudes of her
prosperous commerce, and scarcely mentions the bloody factions of
her pampered citizens. None of the great scenes which influence the
world’s destiny were acted within her walls. Her sons were nurtured
in wealth and luxury, and though among them were numbered
physicians, philosophers, grammarians, and arithmeticians, history
records not that other arts than those of the fancy—the
charioteers,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span> and the
pugilists—were cultivated with eminent success. The medals often
found in its soil are both rare and beautiful; but the marbles are
not of first-rate merit. Many valuable inscriptions are probably
buried beneath its surface; but it would require both large funds
and much time to attempt, with fair prospect of success, an
investigation of its ruins.</p>

<p>I believe that this account of the present condition of Cyrene,
though vague, conveys a not unfaithful idea of its state. The
destruction is, in fact, so complete, and the masses overthrown so
gigantic, that one can hardly ascribe the present havoc to the hand
of man, or the wasting decay of ages. Though there are now no
appearances of volcanic action, we find mention of earthquakes in
Synesius; and the whole of the sea-coast, as seen at Benghazi and
Apollonia, has subsided—an evidence, at least, of the presence of
volcanic forces; and by this agency alone does it seem possible
that such utter destruction could have been caused. The greater
devourer of the cities of antiquity, a modern town rising in the
vicinity, has not here aided the destroyer; for the seventh century
is the very latest date that can be ascribed to any single building
in a very wide circuit; and the nature of the country, cut up by
ravines, and for ages destitute of roads, renders the transport of
heavy blocks of stone impossible. If its present destruction be due
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> the nomad tribes
(of whose attacks Synesius speaks), who feared that Cyrene might
again become a flourishing city, and their mistress, we cannot,
after admiring the laborious energy of her builders, but wonder at
the persevering fury of her destroyers.</p>

<p>The remains of sculpture, as I have indicated, though not few,
are all of a late age, and none in the best style of art; I except
the three dancing figures, a bas-relief on limestone, near the
fountain, now, alas! sadly mutilated. They are even now worthy a
place in a museum, as they are of great artistic interest, showing
the passage from the archaic style of the Egina marbles to the more
graceful execution of the classic school. I think I recognised,
near the theatre in the street of Battus, the torso of a statue
designed in Pacho’s work, and by him called a Cæsar, but it has
suffered much from mutilation, and can never have possessed the
merit he ascribes to it. Very many headless statues are scattered
about, which would be beautiful decorations for a garden, but are
all unworthy of a museum.</p>

<p>The rock which forms the hills, and of which the town is built,
is a yellowish limestone, filled with fossil shells, for the most
part bivalves, and of very unequal compactness. By exposure to the
weather it acquires a gray tone, and frequently becomes
honey-combed. In some places the marks of the chisel in the
stones<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> are as sharp
as the day they were cut—in others, the air and rain have rounded
off their edges; and one sees walls still standing which look as if
built of flattened eggs, showing large interstices between the now
rounded stones.</p>

<p>To sum up in a few words, the traveller finds enough to convey
the general impression of the past splendour of a luxurious city,
but little to satisfy a refined taste, and nothing of which it can
be said, if we except the great reservoir, “This is indeed
magnificent!” In a commercial community, containing philosophers
and physicians, the theatre and the turf may be cultivated as
relaxations from the money-getting toils of the desk, but, as far
as I remember, excepting aristocratic Venice, history furnishes no
example of such a people having attained more than an initiative
excellence in the fine arts.</p>

<p class="csum">Interview with the Bey. — Arab Feast. — The Bey’s
Hospitality.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">August</span> 10.—A few days after
arriving in Grennah, having obtained a general idea of the ruins,
and made such arrangements as were likely to conduce to a
comfortable stay, I went to pay my respects to Bekir Bey, as the
Turks call Bu Bekr Hadud, the Governor of the Arabs in this
district. I had been introduced to him by the Kaimahan in Benghazi,
who, besides a verbal recommendation, had furnished me with letters
to him. His residence is a castle, which I found him still engaged
in building, at Caicab, a place about four hours distant from
Grennah, lying between the two roads to Derna; and from here, with
the fifty soldiers who are at his orders, he manages to keep the
country in subjection, and his enemies—who are many—say, to rob it
into the bargain. His family<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_56">[56]</span> has long been one of the most powerful in the
country; and he is sheikh of the Berasa, a tribe counting ten
clans. The sheikhs of the other clans are subordinate to him; and
by intrigue or violence, each employed at the right time, he has
made himself really the independent governor of the country, which
he rules with an iron hand, under such protection as his guards
afford him, amidst clans of his own tribe who have sworn his death.
His life has been one of strange vicissitudes; at one time—under
the last native sovereign, Youssouf Pacha, whom the Porte, with the
help of the English Consul General, so cleverly dethroned, or
rather, I should say, who so stupidly allowed himself to be
smuggled out of his country—he was fourteen months a prisoner in
irons in Tripoli. His language is now that of the most abject
submission, but he carries things his own way notwithstanding. He
pays to the Porte a yearly sum of 48,000 dollars, extracting from
the Arabs nearly twice as much; the greater part is destined to
swell his own money-bags, the rest being used, according to the
approved receipt in this country, to anoint the eyes of his
superiors in Benghazi and Tripoli. In person he is strongly built,
but not tall, having the finest chest and arm I ever beheld; but
his features are coarse, and his eye twinkles with indescribable
cunning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>I arrived about
eleven o’clock, and found the Bey seated in his divan, and
surrounded by at least forty persons, most of whom were squatted on
the floor; he was seated in the corner, on a raised board, not
unlike a tailor’s, which ran about twelve feet along one side of
the room. When I entered, the assembly was dismissed; and I seated
myself beside him, having on my other hand three sheikhs of his
tribe, one of whom, his brother, Mansour, is a still more
ferocious, though less cunning, politician than himself. He it is
who can eat an entire sheep at a sitting—a tale which I believe
after seeing his performance at an extra meal which was prepared
for me, when he excused himself for eating so little, on the score
of bad health. In addition to these three, there remained also the
Deftudar, or Secretary-Accountant, whose functions also included
waiting at table. His place was on a straw sofa, on which were
collected all the implements of his calling: a small box, a ream of
paper, a pair of scissors for cutting his despatches or orders into
proper form, a board for counting money, and a waist-inkstand; open
letters with their answers were scattered round him, in what seemed
inextricable confusion. After all the usual inquiries after health
and temper, and when coffee and lemonade had been served, the Bey
resumed his business, while several of the former assembly
returned, some to have their complaints discussed,
others<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> to get a
nearer view of the stranger. He, knowing that the Bedawin do not
smoke, regarding this habit as a dirty trick (they only chew
tobacco, mixed with nitre), had taken the precaution of carrying
his pipe with him, to keep himself in countenance during the long
pauses of an Arab visit. This and Mohammed’s exaggerated stories of
him—how he ate and drank, and above all, how he washed in a tub,
and slept on a bed—which were circulated in an undertone, made the
company vote him no better than a Turk, a hateful, but highly
respected character. The Bey from time to time turned round to bawl
out some phrases of exaggerated compliment, in a voice like that of
one of his camels, and then would continue to investigate the case
before him, till, getting animated, he would utter a dozen
“Wallahis” in a breath, throwing his arms about in a manner that
might well alarm his neighbour; then he would pull his beard two or
three times, and, finally, would finish the discussion by applying
the interior of his thumb-nail to that of his upper teeth, making a
slight cracking noise, which meant that nothing more was to be got
out of him. But it is not to be supposed that the audience sat
listening, in respectful silence, to this torrent of words: the
subjects were as energetic as their ruler, and he who listened to
the tones, or beheld the gestures which accompanied them, would
think that they must soon come to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_59">[59]</span> blows. When I first met Bu Bekr in Benghazi,
I was astonished at the loud, rough tone in which he spoke; but
after seeing a little more of the Bedawin (who all speak as if from
the mountain-tops), and assisting at a council at Caicab, it was
easy to account for it. Indeed, the good man could not whisper: he
tried to do so, putting his arms round a servant’s neck, and
placing his lips close to his ear, when he ordered a luncheon,
dinner, or whatever it must be called, to be prepared for me. I had
arrived too late for their dinner; and, after much whispering in a
loud tone, and the interchange of one or two notes with his
Secretary (perhaps to show me that there is one Bey who can write),
he ordered another dinner for me. I was not supposed to hear or
understand anything of his hospitable intentions; and, after an
hour and a half of fatiguing inaction, in the midst of this
Babel-like hubbub, I rose to take my leave. This he would not
allow, and seizing a shoulder with one iron hand, and a leg with
the other, he pulled me back to my place. I thus had to sit, making
what little conversation my confined vocabulary would admit of, for
four hours longer, whilst the banquet was being prepared. When the
carpet was at last spread, and the tray placed upon it, I confess I
was disappointed, though little inclined to eat, to find that the
ladies of the harem had not profited by this long interval
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> furnish some
delicate cates. There was soup—a sort of greenish porridge, filled
with rice and onions; then came two dishes of stewed mutton, with
vegetables; this was followed by two dishes of stewed mutton, with
potatoes; and, finally, a huge wooden bowl of rice, some thirty
inches in diameter, crowned with an entire roasted lamb. Plates of
water-melon, from Benghazi, completed the feast. I have described
the dinner, all fear of criticism notwithstanding, as it was meant
to be a splendid feed, and the host is the wealthiest man in the
country. The chief fault I found with it was the long time it
detained me in Caicab, thereby occasioning me two hours’ ride in
the dark. The Bey, his brother, and Mohammed (whose last wife, by
the way, was a <i>divorcée</i> of Bu Bekr’s), did honour to the
entertainment; the two former picking out, and putting beneath my
fingers, the delicate morsels; and I must do them the justice to
say, that, with true politeness, not an effort was made to make me
eat more largely than I was inclined to do. The appetite which
comes in eating aided me to make a most substantial luncheon; but,
beside the others, I was like a canary-bird amongst ostriches.
Mohammed, I heard, could eat no supper; he was ill and useless all
the next day.</p>

<p>This rough, but abundant hospitality, not unbefitting the
traditional idea of an Arab sheikh, is exercised on<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span> a most liberal scale by Bu Bekr;
and the enormous drain it must be on his fortune may, possibly,
justify him in his own eyes for the unscrupulous means by which he
augments it. At some seasons, the expenses of his court can be
little short of 20<em>l</em>. a day; and to meet this, the Turkish
Government allows him 11<em>l</em>. a month. An acquaintance, who
spent some evenings with him this summer, told me that he had
counted 378 rations for horses, given out in one evening for the
guests; while 86 sheep had been slaughtered, to supply their
personal wants. Perhaps he is by nature thus liberal, and only from
education succumbs to the Arab fondness for the clinging metal.</p>

<p class="csum">Meditations at Sunrise. — Violation of the Tombs. —
Description of the Tombs. — Allegorical Figures. — Splendid Tomb. —
Curious Tombs. — Lively Vale. — Unartistic Statues.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">August</span> 23.—I have
described, as I can, the ancient city; but the Necropolis, which
yet remains to be visited, is, in fact, still, as in old times, the
glory of Cyrene. Among its thousands of monuments, many retain
traces of their ancient magnificence, and some still present great
beauties of detail. My descriptions, such as they are here given,
were written on the spot, after repeated visits; and this morning,
in no unfitting mood, I began my task. The growling camels round my
tent, the bleating sheep at the fountain above, roused me earlier
than usual; and I prepared to set out upon my round, while the cool
air invited to exertion, and the first rays of the sun gilded the
summits<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> of the hills.
To most men such bright mornings are exhilarating; and the pursuit
of the red-legged partridge, with dog and gun, would seem more
suitable to the hour, than a walk among the tombs. But to me they
are associated with recollections too painfully in unison with my
present task. Twice at this season the sun has shone for me on
scenes of deepest affliction. By its morning light, I have received
those heart-wounds which never heal—the loss of the well-loved
parents, whose affection no love can replace; of the friend of
youthful days, which can never return. Such a morning was it, this
day twelve years ago, when thou, O Marcellus, wert snatched from
us, in the springtide of youth, in the force of thy strength, and
talent, and manly beauty. After that long, weary night, during
which I had sat watching alone, by the dim lamp, each unconscious
movement, when all hope was gone, and each long-drawn gasp sent a
fresh pang from thy heart to mine, the morning light stole through
the ill-closed shutters; and hoping without hope, I opened the
window to admit fresh air to thy labouring chest. The gay sun-rays
burst in upon the chamber of death, the swift waters of the Rhine
danced by, refulgent in the morning splendour, and unsympathising
nature seemed to awaken to gladness, whilst the tenderest ties that
friendship ever formed were immaturely rent asunder. Long years
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> passed since
that sad morning; yet have I not learned to forget, or ceased to
mourn thee. No companion thou of the debauch; the friendship which
survives the long parting was not formed in the haunts of
dissipation. If thy wit flashed bright at the festal board—in the
intimacy of the chamber, thy tender feeling elevated, as thy
learning and taste instructed. Cut off in earliest youth—cruel
favour of the gods!—a few friends alone knew thy worth; one, at
least, still mourns, and never has replaced thee in his heart. In
the wilderness of the great Babylon each turn recalls thee; and
here, in the city of countless tombs, thy image rises to my memory,
and accompanies my pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Some feelings of melancholy must be awakened in every visitor,
as he follows those long lines of violated sepulchres, ranged along
the sides of the hills, obtruding far into the plain below, and
stretching in every direction across the table-land to the south.
The simple sarcophagus and proud mausoleum now alike gape
tenantless; perpetuating neither the affection of the survivors nor
the merits of the dead, they are mute as to their history, their
fate, and almost their names. Barbarian hands have disturbed the
relics, and rifled the treasures which they once contained; the
existence of such treasures must have been the incentive to, and
can alone account for, the universal violation of the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span> tombs—hatred, if profitless as
well as toilsome, is seldom thus unrelenting.</p>

<p>ROCK TOMBS ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE NECROPOLIS AT CYRENE.</p>

<p><a href="images/i04_large.jpg">(<i>Large-size</i>)</a>
</p>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The influence of the vicinity, and, at one time, the domination
of Egypt, seems to have inspired the Cyreneans with the same
anxious reverence for the dead which distinguished their
neighbours; and they seem early to have abandoned the habit of
incremation, though it is not evident that they adopted that of
embalming. Few of the monuments are fitted for the reception of
urns, and the very few bones which are sometimes met with, bear no
marks of burning.</p>

<p>The northern face of the eastern hill seems to have been the
first place used for sepulture; and, judging from the style, I
should think that some monuments, about half a mile from the
fountain, on the road to Apollonia, are among the earliest. They
are large sepulchres, with façades cut in the solid rock, with
porticoes, in a very early Greek, almost Egyptian, style. I am
inclined to think that the sepulchres, which are entirely
excavated, without any adjuncts of masonry, are of two epochs, the
earliest and latest: the former, though generally rude, impressive
in their monolithic vastness; the latter, in their meretriciously
minute though graceful decorations, reminding me forcibly of
Pompeii. Some of these one finds, in which the smoothed rock is
scored with lines, to imitate masonry, like the stuccoed houses of
Belgravia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> To an
intermediate period—that of the greatest prosperity—I ascribe the
cave-tombs, faced with masonry, and the circular and temple-shaped
monuments which are so frequent; while the plain sarcophagus,
rising from the rock on which it was hewn, may belong to any epoch.
The road to Apollonia ran along the side of the hill, at about half
its elevation; and, above and below, the tombs are built in long
lines, tier above tier, forming, in some places, as many as twelve
terraces, connected together by flights of steps.</p>

<p>The disposition in each form of tomb varies but little. The
sarcophagus contained, in general, room for one occupant; though I
found an instance where two bodies had been deposited in the same
excavation, one above the other, with a stone to separate them. The
cave-sepulchres have, in general, a forecourt, excavated in the
hill, presenting internally a low chamber, containing four or six
plain sarcophagi, cut in the sides, and as many, or even a greater
number, of similar cavities sunk in the floor. There are some which
form a long, narrow gallery, on which open lateral chambers, each
capable of containing two sarcophagi in length, and two or three
tiers, one above the other. The interiors are, in general, left
quite rough, without remaining marks of decoration: a few have been
plastered and painted, and others present beautiful finishing of
the stone-work inside. Those<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_67">[67]</span> hewn in the rock, and adorned with a façade
of masonry, were, in their original state, undoubtedly the most
magnificent, as shown by the frequent remains of columns and
statues, but they are now the least interesting. The façade has, in
general, fallen away, leaving the sepulchre, with its bare wall and
shapeless entrance, the ghastly spectacle of a fleshless skull. In
only one case did I find such a façade still entire; it has
separated from the rock, and leans slightly forward, ready to fall
in the first violent rains. It seemed to me the better worth
remarking, as it explains the many smooth surfaces the rock
presents, as well as the decoration applied to the fountain.</p>

<p>Among the most interesting tombs in the northern Necropolis are
three, standing together, at a place where the road, following the
outline of the hill, makes a deep bend. They are monolithic, and in
one, the Doric columns, which support the excavated porticoes in
front of the cave, are of abnormal proportions. Beneath them,
descending the abrupt hill, on the third or fourth tier—it is
difficult to say which, the tombs, principally sarcophagi, being so
closely grouped—is a sepulchre without any external ornament, but
exhibiting on its interior walls the only frescoes of any merit I
have found. On the right hand, and on either side of the doorway,
the paintings are well preserved; those on the other two sides are,
excepting two groups, almost obliterated<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_68">[68]</span> by the peeling off of the plaster in some
places, in others by a hard, stalactitic crust which has formed on
them. The inscriptions scribbled over the ground, partly with the
brush, partly scratched with a point, have bestowed a certain
interest on these paintings, in which Pacho, who has not given
quite a correct delineation of the paintings, thought he had
discovered indications of Judaism. The inscriptions, scarcely
legible, seem to consist of the names of visitors, and to the
unlearned offer no interest. The whole series evidently refer to
the games of the ancients; chariot-races, gladiators, wrestlers,
and pugilists, occupying the two sides which are damaged. There are
two wrestlers, with a third figure, who seems to be taking a flying
leap over their heads, but who may be intended to be lying on the
ground overcome, while the judge, with the prize-cup, or, perhaps,
the oil for anointing, looks on in the corner. To the right are two
figures, one of whom seems to be inviting the first, a youth, to
enter a doorway to which he points; which I conjecture to be the
introduction of a youth to the study of rhetoric or poetry. It is
here the inscriptions begin. The action of the next two figures is
indistinguishable. We next see a figure in long drapery, crowned
with ivy or vine-leaves, his right hand extended, in his left a
lyre. An orator, or poet, with a roll in his hand, follows next;
and, after him, the same draped figure, now<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_69">[69]</span> playing on the lyre. The next group is,
unfortunately, much damaged, as its composition is remarkable. It
contains eight figures, all crowned with ivy; the fourth blowing
the double horn; before them goes a nude figure, bearing a square
chest. Here there is a figure now headless, and again the musician
playing on the lyre, surrounded by seven persons. A male figure, in
a tragic masque, appears to be declaiming to a female also masqued,
who is surrounded by seven other females, crowned with garlands. I
could discover in these paintings no trace of Jewish origin; two of
the figures still remaining, which Pacho has represented wearing
mitres, are certainly tragic masques; the lofty hair on the
foreheads of which may have deceived him in the obscurity. Though
roughly executed, they are drawn with great breadth and freedom; in
style they much resemble many of the Pompeian frescoes, to which
time, or rather later, they may be assigned. On either side of the
door, are an animal-fight and a hunt. On one, a bull attacked by a
lion, while a tiger is preparing to spring upon his neck; above are
stags, a gazelle, dogs, and a chacal. Spears are flying all about
the picture. On the other side is a column supporting a vase, a man
launching a greyhound, almost in the position of Gibson’s hunter, a
stag, two hares, and some more dogs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>Further on in the
same range, at a place where the old road, with the deep-worn ruts
of the chariot wheels, is still visible, is a very large collection
of sepulchral chambers, called by the Arabs Kenissich, or the
Church. There are remains of a large forecourt of masonry, of which
only parts of the sides are still standing; but though very
spacious, exceeding in extent any other excavation in Cyrene, it
contains neither inscriptions nor emblems. Nothing in it indicates
that it was ever used either for the religious rites or the burial
of Christians, as from its name some travellers have supposed. It
must be remembered that names such as this have no origin in
traditions of the country, as its present inhabitants ascribe all
that they see to the Christians (the Roum); they have no idea that
any race of men occupied the country before them. To this is to be
ascribed their excessive jealousy of antiquarian travellers, whom
they believe to come furnished with information which will enable
them to remove the treasures left by their ancestors, according to
Arab belief, in secret places. I should conjecture that this vast
series of chambers must have been appropriated to some civic or
religious corporation, as its extent is far too great to have been
intended for a single family.</p>

<p>This line of sepulchres, with its terrace, connected by flights
of steps, extends in unbroken succession for<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_71">[71]</span> about a mile and a half, till it reaches a
beautifully-wooded hill, where the tombs become rarer. Amongst the
immense heaps of stones fallen from the façades of the larger, are
often seen fragments of marble, and excavations have uncovered many
portrait-statues in every part of the Necropolis.</p>

<p>Turning back to the old theatre, there is found immediately
beneath it the most splendid tomb which the ruins of Cyrene
present, both from its gigantic dimensions and the excellent style
of its architecture. It is entirely excavated, without any
additions of masonry, presenting a large portico, supported by five
square pillars, which forms a stately entrance to a very large
chamber, succeeded by a smaller one. The centre pillars, with the
rock which they supported, have fallen, and lie in one huge mass in
front of the cave. It is now the habitation of a Bedawy, who one
day very pressingly invited me to enter, to see his marble boxes,
the fragments of two very elegantly-carved sarcophagi. Beneath this
are the arches which I have already mentioned as belonging to a
temple; and in the face of the hill, still further down, are some
very large tombs, now devoid of all appearance of decoration.</p>

<p>In whatever direction one leaves the city, the tombs extend in
long lines along the principal roads, they are found cut in the
rocks of the most secluded valley,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_72">[72]</span> or built in groups on the summit of rising
grounds. Of these the most interesting, beside the northern
Necropolis, are those which flank the old road leading to Baria,
and the long terraces on the western side of the Wady Bil Ghadir. I
did not see the former till after I had been some time in Grennah,
other objects having engaged all my attention; but, even when
accustomed to the variety and vastness of its northern Necropolis,
this struck me with astonishment. It was a lovely summer evening
when I first came upon this long street of tombs, which is called
by the Arabs the Market-place (El-suk), and passed for such with
one of the earliest European travellers in this country—Lemaire.
The long, deep shadows, with the glowing yellow of the sinking sun,
concealed the ravages of time, and gave to the scene an air of
solemn mystery which impressed the imagination and the eye. At
every step some picturesque group of sarcophagi, or some large
mausoleum, arrested the attention, and the sun had long set before
I turned homewards. I often revisited this scene, and each time
with renewed enjoyment. To reach it, one leaves the city by the
gate near to what is supposed to have been the market-place of
later times, when the traces of the old road soon show themselves.
It is flanked on the left by a rock, artificially smoothed, and
covered in a long row with niches square or oblong, and about
one-third of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> their
length in depth. Some have a square hole at the bottom, about three
inches deep, which, though sometimes in the centre, is more often
on one side. Such niches I have met with in other places, but here
they are more numerous, and in a continuous line for some distance,
interrupted once or twice by the door of a sepulchre. Their object
it is difficult to determine; they could not have contained urns,
for they are too small, as well as too exposed, being not more than
three feet above the level of the road. They might have been
regarded as receptacles for exvotos, had they been placed at a
greater height. In this line of tombs are some remarkable
structures, peculiar, I believe, to the Cyrenaica—circles of five
or six feet high, surrounding a sarcophagus of the usual form. Most
of them are in a very dilapidated condition, but there is one still
nearly entire. It is formed of three layers of good masonry, making
a square platform, on which the sarcophagus is placed, with a
circle inscribed in the square of the base, formed by a ring of
stones placed endwise in juxtaposition, no cement remaining between
them; their dimensions are about five feet by three.</p>

<p>At the end of this street of tombs, turning to the left, and
riding between low hills, where excavations and remains of
buildings are rare, one comes to a quarter of the Necropolis unique
in its <i>ensemble</i>, but<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_74">[74]</span> not in its individual parts. I have already
mentioned the sarcophagi hewn out from the solid rock, which are
found so frequently mixed with tombs of other forms; here they
occur in large groups, rising one above the other, on the tops of
the low hills out of which they are cut. The four sides of some of
these sarcophagi stand clear of the rock, which is levelled all
round; in others, only three sides or two are thus freed; many are
in connected groups, three or four in a line, with no other
external separation than a small space between their lids, and a
narrow watercourse, to drain off the rains falling from their
sloping roofs.</p>

<p>Continuing to make a wide circuit of the city, one comes upon
the ruins of two forts, in one of which is a large cistern; thence,
keeping to the left, the monuments are more scattered, but they
assume larger proportions, and date, probably, from the times of
the greatest prosperity. Some are circular towers on a square base,
like the tomb of Cecilia Metella, near Rome; others have the form
of a double cube, with roofs sloping at the sides, and terminated
at the ends with triangular frontons. A partition, running the
length of the building, generally separates these into two
chambers, having a further division in height, so as to form two
stories. The greater number of tombs in this direction present
vestiges of former enrichment<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_75">[75]</span> with statues or marble, and their sides are
invariably decorated with flat pilasters. Most of these monuments
are erected over excavated caves, which gives the idea of their
being connected; the monument may have been added to the original
cave-tomb, or the former destined for the master, and the latter
for his slaves or freedmen. No part of the ruins of Cyrene offers
so good a chance of profitable excavations as the tombs in this
direction, but I am not sanguine in the hopes of the discovery of
any objects in the highest style of art. Not a trace of an
inscription is to be found on any of these monuments.</p>

<p>In the western valley, Wady Bil Ghadir, some of the finest tombs
are found, on the side of the hill opposite to that one on which
the older part of the town lay. This part is very attractive by its
bold and picturesque scenery. Here is a deep ravine, forming an
impregnable defence to this side of the town, the rocks on either
hand towering almost perpendicularly above the narrow bed of the
streamlet formed by its three fountains. Towards the higher point
on one side is a small grove of most venerable cypresses (the
remains, perhaps, of that planted by Battus), which crown the rock,
and overshadow the tombs on the terraces below. The fig-tree, the
olive, and the myrtle (here a tree twenty feet high), surround the
tombs with luxuriant thickets, out of which streamlets<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> issue, whose course far beneath
is marked by thick bushes of oleanders crowned with their rosy
flowers, and brambles covered at the same time with their pale
blossoms, and with ripening fruit. Some of the tombs in this valley
are the most elegant in their proportions, and the most carefully
executed of any I have met with in this country; two or three still
exhibit the polychromatic decoration of their architecture, and in
a few are inscriptions, giving, indeed, only the names of the
tenants without either title or date; but even these are
interesting, when among them one finds a Jason, an Aristotle, and a
Themistocles. The interesting pictures in fresco, representing a
black female slave, which decorated the exterior of a tomb high up
in one of the branches of this ravine, have been removed by M.
Bourville, lately consular agent for France in Benghazi, and I hope
that the intrinsic merit of the paintings, of which the engravings
certainly make it difficult to judge, is such that their removal
may add to our knowledge of ancient art. If not superior to those
in the tomb I have described in the Northern Necropolis, their
acquisition will add little to the treasures of the Louvre; their
absence here is a disappointment to the lover of art. Two of the
fountains show the remains of ancient sanctuaries near them, and
inscriptions have been found connecting their erection with the
name of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span> a pious
matron. Many statues have been dug up on the sides of the hill, the
best of which have been removed by their discoverers; those that
remain exhibit the worst taste in design, and the clumsiest
execution; their style is that of the statues produced in the
masons’ yards at Leghorn, and intended, I believe, by the artists
and the purchasers, whoever they may be, as ornaments for
gardens.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">The</span> Wady Bil Ghadir, the
Valley of Verdure, was one of the many beautiful ravines in this
country which particularly attracted my admiration; it was one of
my favourite haunts; and often did I climb its sides—occasionally
at the risk of my neck—or saunter more safely in the perpetual
shade of its stream-course. In the neighbourhood of Grennah, the
hills abound with beautiful scenes, and these I gradually
discovered in my rides; some of them exceeded in richness of
vegetation, and equalled in grandeur, anything that is to be found
in the Appenines. About a mile from the town on the south, one
comes upon extensive remains of a fortress situated on the edge of
one of these ravines, the Wady Leboaitha, which runs nearly due
east; the valley is filled with<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_79">[79]</span> tombs, and frequented by countless flights of
wood-pigeons. Following the ravine, and turning to the left, we
enter the Wady Shelaleh, which presents a scene beyond my powers of
description. The olive is here contrasted with the fig, the tall
cypress and the dark juniper with the arbutus and myrtle, and the
pleasant breeze, which always blows through the valley, is laden
with balmy perfumes. In the midst of this wonderful richness of
nature appear the gray rocks, hollowed into large and inaccessible
caverns, or gently receding in wooded slopes, and sometimes rising
perpendicularly, and meeting so as to leave but a narrow passage
between them.</p>

<p>Between the range of hills on which Cyrene was built, and the
rising ground which so abruptly descends to the sea-shore, the
broad plain, which from above seems a flat expanse, is found to be
deeply indented with many wood-clad hollows. On their borders,
ruined buildings or crumbling tombs contrast with the wooden hut of
the present occupant of the soil—the monumental industry of fallen
civilisation with the slothful hut of victorious barbarism.</p>

<p><em>August</em> 29.—It was a bright cool morning when I started
to visit Marsa Souya, the old Apollonia. The road follows the line
of the cemetery until it reaches the hill whose secular cypresses I
have so often admired; hence it descends into the plain, taking
nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span> a north-east
direction. At an hour from Grennah I came upon excavations which
must have formed part of the dependencies of a country-house. In a
good-sized cave, into which one descends by three steps, is seen a
large circular basin hollowed in the rock, four feet in diameter,
and standing about ten inches above the floor. In its centre is a
square hole, as if for fixing an upright beam. One side of the cave
is occupied by a long stone bench, in which is hollowed out a
larger mortar, having a slit down the outer side. There can be no
reasonable doubt that this was an oil press. The country still
abounds with fine old olive trees, but its inhabitants have
forgotten their use; when the fruit is ripe, they assemble their
sheep and cattle round the trees and shake and beat the branches,
while the animals greedily devour the precious produce as it falls
to the ground. The plain is in this direction covered with the
olive mixed with the caroub, now loaded with its long dark pods.
When left thus to the hand of nature, the caroub becomes an immense
bush, pushing out suckers all round the parent trunk, which in size
is hardly to be distinguished among them. The Bedawin have taken
possession of many of the largest of these trees, and make them
their summer residence, clearing out the centre and filling up the
lower parts with walls of dry branches, above which the dark-green
foliage rises with strange effect to the eye, but<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span> affording a most grateful shade
from the sun. In such a bower I found four men seated round a rude
forge repairing broken muskets; while in others women were employed
in household cares, such as the grinding of flour, or the weaving
of the coarse hair-cloth of which the winter tents are made. From
here we turned to seek a pass through the hills, and as the old
road has now become, if not impracticable, at least most difficult
for horses, we took a path a little to the left, passing over
ground covered with old junipers; the twisted and contorted
ash-gray trunks of these trees, and their small tufts of hoary
green, for they have no other vegetation when very old, give the
forest an appearance of decrepitude. The trees look like little old
men bent, and bowed, and bald. From this the descent to the coast,
even by the better road we had followed, is very precipitous. The
supply of water had been forgotten, and a leather bag of milk,
offered by a goatherd whom we met, was most welcome. Having at
last, after much slipping and stumbling, reached the point where
the pass emerges from the hills, we found ourselves in a fertile
plain, which it took nearly an hour to traverse before reaching the
sea. The water is bad and scarce, and this plain is, therefore,
only inhabited in the winter, when it is sown with wheat and
barley, and as soon as these crops are cut, the Arabs, with their
tents, remove to a station in the hills. The
inhabitants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span> were long
since in the summer retreat, but we found two men threshing corn by
the antique process of treading, which, as all readers of books of
travels know, is still practised in parts of Egypt and Syria. I do
not remember to have seen the process described as I found it
practised here, and there may be others who may think it as curious
as it seemed to me. Four oxen abreast are fastened together by the
horns, their heads close to each other; a fifth is in like way
fastened to the inner one of these four, but the rope which secures
his horns is tied round the middle of the belly of a sixth, whose
head is in the same way fastened to him. This last pair, when
driven, form as it were a revolving pivot, round which the four
others move. One man drives them, and another is employed in
heaping fresh corn upon the floor, and removing the straw which, by
this process, is broken into small lengths, while the grain is,
after all, but imperfectly separated from it. Riding on through the
plain, we found it, though cultivated, extensively covered with the
beautiful evergreen shrub, called in Italy, and here by the Arabs,
<i>Baturne</i>; it yields a medicinal berry. We now reached a group
of low rocks hollowed out into many sepulchral caves. The soil has
a reddish tint (whose reflection is heating to the eyes), which
with a bright sun made the ride a hot one. On the sea-shore, just
without the town, and opposite to a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_83">[83]</span> rocky island covered with excavations and
ruins, we found a well of very brackish water, which is the only
one in this neighbourhood; the town had been formerly supplied by
the water of a fountain nearly three miles off, conveyed to it by
an aqueduct, portions of whose ruins we had passed. This want of
water renders a stay here very inconvenient, and prevented me
following my original intention of spending some days in this
place. The city was built on a semicircular line of rocks close to
the shore, and buildings are still visible beneath the waters which
have here encroached upon the old boundaries, probably by
subsidence of the land. The fortifications on the land side are
well preserved, and remarkable for a large round tower still almost
entire, which rises at the south-west corner; it is connected with
some large buildings in this part of the city, apparently of a
castle; towers flank the wall at irregular distances, and the
position of one gate is well marked, though now blocked up by
fallen ruins. Clambering over the wall one gains the interior of
the city, which is crowded with heaps of ruins, and presents the
same confusion as a child’s castle of wooden bricks when the last
story has rendered it top-heavy and the whole falls upon itself.
Some arches rise above the soil, and in a few places pieces of
wall; the ground is thickly strewed with large heaps of stone,
columns of white marble and cipollino,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_84">[84]</span> whose capitals are in general of indifferent
workmanship. The sites of ten large churches, each with an apse,
are easily traced; and the columns and cones of the capitals,
adorned with the hall and cross, seem to indicate the fifth century
as their date. The difficulty of excavating would be extreme, on
account of the size of the heaps of stone which cover the ground,
and the weight of the masses; but this circumstance, rendering it
almost impossible for the Arabs to make any researches among the
ruins, may probably have secured for the first person who is able
to undertake the costly task, a rich harvest of early Christian
antiquities. The theatre, outside the town, is more perfectly
preserved than anything within it; nearly one-half of the seats
remain, but the proscenium has long since fallen into the sea,
whose encroaching waters now fill the orchestra.</p>

<p>Returning by the same road I turned to the right, about an hour
and a half from Grennah, to see the great caves called Maghyenat by
the Arabs, and which are, in fact, supposed to have served as
magazines for the merchandise coming from Apollonia to Cyrene. They
are situated at the foot of a hill, which is covered with ruins,
including those of a temple; everything seems to indicate that in
this spot a considerable town must have once existed, though the
imperfect notices of the ancient geography of this country which
have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span> reached us, do
not mention a town or village in this place. The caves are very
extensive, supported by rude columns, irregularly disposed. One has
a square fore-court cut in the rock, and seems to have been adorned
with a façade; another has a broad flight of steps leading down to
the interior, which is covered with an archway in masonry. There
are three of these caves, from 100 to 120 feet square, and they
show nothing that could lead to the conjecture that they were ever
intended for sepulture; while their situation, as well as the name
they have preserved to the present day, render the supposition that
they served as magazines highly probable. I found one filled with
hay and grain, and another was occupied as the habitation of
several families. Turning homewards from this place, and crossing a
deep ravine, we reached a very large natural circus at the foot of
the hills, from above which flowed an abundant stream. The
elliptical form was so perfectly defined that it was long before I
could persuade myself that it had not been used as a circus in
ancient times; but, though there are remains of building about the
fountain, the remainder showed no appreciable marks of cutting away
of the rock to form seats, or of the addition of masonry to
complete the circuit. Another hour brought us, with the setting
sun, back to the tents.</p>

<p><em>Tuesday, September</em> 7.—This morning I rode
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> the sea-shore,
taking a north-west direction, to visit some ruins, which an Arab
had assured me existed there. I was in hope of finding some remains
of Phycus, which must have existed in this direction, or of the
Garden of the Hesperides, which Scylax and other old authorities
place in its neighbourhood. The country as far as the hills
differed in no respect from that I had already seen—exhibiting a
plain partly of rich soil, partly of rock, and cut up with deep
ravines. We rode down the Wady El Agâra, and reaching the hills,
found, at a distance of two hours from Cyrene, ruins, apparently of
a stronghold, on which is now built a marābut, called Sidi Kelileh.
It is remarkable that so many of these chapels, raised over the
graves of reputed saints, should be met with in all Moslem
countries, and that even the tomb of the Prophet should be a
mosque; for this mode of honouring the dead is the object of a
special prohibition, uttered, one would think, in too solemn a
moment to be lightly transgressed. In El Tabaray’s account of the
Prophet’s death, he relates, on the authority of a tradition
derived from Aïsha, his favourite wife, that on the day when he
died, as he lay covered with a black cloak, his face to the wall,
almost his last words were, “May God be unpropitious to those who
make the tombs of his prophets places of prayer.” I know not how
the difficulty is got over; perhaps, such tombs (being
inside<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span> the chapels,
or inclosed in railings, so that prayers are not said <em>upon</em>
them) are not supposed to come within the meaning of the
prohibition; in all Moslem countries many such chapels are found,
and in no country more frequently than in this, where ignorant
fanaticism still exists in a degree unequalled in the other Turkish
provinces I have visited.</p>

<p>From Sidi Kelileh we reached the summit of the range in an hour,
and saw the sea at a gun-shot from the base of the thickly-wooded
hill. Far to the right, the promontory of Nanstathmus, and about
half-way between, on the shore, the ruins of Apollonia; to the
left, the mountain gradually closing upon the sea, which, a little
further on, washes its base; but there is no promontory here
visible, nor had any of the natives ever heard of Ras-sem or Razat.
The only indication which I could find of a promontory was at a
point called El Bilanîch, where the shore makes a very slight bend
outwards, and above it the hills rise lofty, and very thickly
wooded. A little to the right of the place where I descended we
found a spring of sweet water, the only one on this coast—perhaps
therefore the same at which the companions of Ulysses landed, when
driven by stress of weather from off Cape Malia to the country of
the Lotophagi. On the sea-shore, to the left, are the ruins of a
strong tower, built of squared stones without cement, called by the
Arabs Arbîah,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> which
seems to have served only as a fortalice, for there are no remains
to indicate here the site of a town. Further on to the west is a
curious shallow quarry cut in steps, from which the stones for the
tower seem to have been extracted; and a little further on, a
modern Arab khan, called Furtâs, in the walls of which ancient
materials are built. Thence I rode on to Bilanîeh, where I found
some excavations and levelled places on the rock, which may mark
the site of Phycus. The sea-line from here turning slightly west by
south-west, there seems no other place which will answer to the
description of Phycus. I now climbed the hill above El Bilanîeh,
and not finding the Garden of the Hesperides, whose golden fruit
would have been most grateful, I rested for a couple of hours under
a stunted ilex. The face of the hill was very steep, and the horses
had hard work among the smooth rocks in some places, but it only
took half an hour to reach the summit, from which the table-land at
once extends. Two hours and a quarter west by north-west of
Grennah, we came upon considerable ruins, consisting of a large
open reservoir; a small building with a well-preserved apse; and a
larger one, probably of Arab construction, as it contained several
pointed arches as well as one round arch. My guide called this
place Shuni. Eastward we met with numerous remains of building and
tombs, presenting nothing<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_89">[89]</span> remarkable; their frequency, however
indicates the populous condition of the country in former times, of
which another proof presented itself on our road homewards in a
large and deep cistern, excavated in the rock, to receive the
rain-waters. After my Arabs had drunk of its very muddy water, we
rode onwards, crossing the Wady Mala’ab, pursued on our very horses
by the fierce barking of the dogs of an Algerian donâr, which had
been for many months pitched in the plain below Grennah. Its
inhabitants were as fine specimens of uncivil fanatics as one need
wish to meet; they did not even deign to call off their dogs when
the Christian stranger passed their circular encampment. Their
chief is somewhat more politic; he frequently visited my tents,
said that the English were good men, who beat the French, and then
begged a supply of shot or writing-paper. He and his companions had
long fought under Abd-el-Kader, and quitted their country rather
than submit to infidel domination.</p>

<p>To conclude my account of the more remarkable excursions around
Grennah, I shall here in a few words speak of the vast conduit
which exists at a place now called Saf-saf. It lies to the
south-east of Grennah, at a distance of an hour and three-quarters,
and is remarkable not only for its magnificent structure, which
resembles in size the Cloaca Maxima of<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_90">[90]</span> Rome (though of a much later date), but also
for the inscriptions, or rather quarry-marks, which are found on
the stones of which the noble arch is built. These are very
curious, containing not only Greek characters, like those in the
reservoir at Cyrene (which this conduit seems to have been destined
to supply), but also other characters, resembling those of the
Tawaricks, or the Thugga inscription. The following I copied, and I
believe it is a tolerably complete list of all that exist in this
place: Α, <img src='images/sym04.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[Symbol]'>,
Δ∇, ΤΡΟ, <img src='images/sym05.jpg' class="sym2" alt='[Symbol]'>,
Π, <img src='images/sym06.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[Symbols]'>,
<img src='images/sym07.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[Symbols]'>, Κ
<img src='images/sym08.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[+]'> <img src=
'images/sym09.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[Symbol]'>, Ω, <img src=
'images/sym10.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[Symbol]'>, <img src=
'images/sym11.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[Symbol]'>, <img src=
'images/sym08.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[+]'>, ×, <img src=
'images/sym12.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[Symbol]'>, <img src=
'images/sym13.jpg' class="sym1" alt='[Symbol]'>, the last six being
apparently Libyan characters—a circumstance not to be wondered at,
if we consider that the aboriginal population of the country would
probably furnish a large contingent to the labouring classes. At
one end the walls are covered with Arabic inscriptions, recording
the visits of various Beys of Benghazi and other personages—a mark
of interest rarely met with in the East. The winter rains were
still collected in this reservoir; and when I was there at the end
of summer, notwithstanding the drought of the last years, there was
still a small supply of water remaining in one part of the vast
archway.</p>

<p>The walls of the town are still to be traced, and the
ground-plans of several buildings; but none are of any importance,
excepting a small temple, with fluted pilasters, only wanting the
roof and fronton, which,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_91">[91]</span> with the entablature, lie on the ground
before it. It is mentioned by Della Cella as a temple of Bacchus,
with a frieze of vine-leaves and grapes, but of these I could
distinguish no trace, and I am inclined to think that the lichens
with which it is overgrown may have, at a distance, deceived him.
The line of tombs extends the whole way from Cyrene to Jafsuf, and
a large conduit covered with heavy stones runs along the side of
the road.</p>

"pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> climate, decked with all the
beauties of nature, will sympathise in the story of the Odyssey,
and easily picture to himself the difficulty with which the Ithacan
tore away his companions from the land of the Lotophagi. A more
delightful residence for the summer months cannot be imagined. The
nights and mornings are always cool. In the daytime the thermometer
ranges from 75° to 98°, the highest I have seen it; but there blows
all day a cool breeze from the sea, which renders the heat
insensible in the tent, and quite endurable on horseback. The means
of comfortable existence are by no means wanting. A sheep costs
from 4<em>s</em>. 6<em>d</em>. to 6<em>s</em>., and will keep good
for four days; vegetables and fruit can be obtained from Derna,
where the grape, the banana, the pear, and the water-melon, are
abundant; potatoes, bamias, tomatoes, cucumbers, and many other
vegetables, may also be had there. Vegetables are likewise
cultivated in this neighbourhood, in the little gardens of the
Bedawin; and the milk of their cows affords the richest cream I
ever tasted, though the pale butter which is made from it is not
very good. A man must, therefore, be very hard to please, as far as
the substantial necessaries of life are concerned, if he be not
satisfied with such fare as this country affords; of course, wine,
beer, biscuits, cheese, and such other superfluities, must be
obtained from Malta. There is also to be had<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_94">[94]</span> here a substitute for the Swiss “<i>cure
de raisins</i>,” in the camel’s-milk, which, from experience, I can
recommend as singularly efficacious. When drunk fresh, it is hardly
to be distinguished from the milk of the cow, though richer; but in
cooling it acquires a most disagreeable salt-taste. Warm or cold,
it is equally efficacious, and might fairly take its place among
the remedies prescribed by the faculty. If nowhere else in Europe,
it might probably be obtained in Pisa, from the farm of the Grand
Duke.</p>

<p>To the traveller who has tarried in Egypt till the spring—who is
tired of Syria, and unwilling to go to Europe, a more delightful
retreat for summer cannot be suggested. The air is far purer than
in any part of Italy, the scenery more beautiful and more varied,
and fever and dysentery are unknown. From early spring to the
middle of October, no rain ever falls, though the sky after the
middle of August is almost always cloudy; a heavy night-dew
supplies the moisture which, at this season, covers the hills with
a fresh coat of verdure. The distance from Alexandria to Derna is
not great, and there is constant communication by sea between the
two places. I should recommend for encampment one of the terraces
in the eastern part of the Wady Bil Ghadir, a little beyond the
first fountain, in descending the Wady from the south, rather than
the fountain by which I pitched my tents. There<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> is here a triangular patch of
ground, beneath a lofty rock, which shelters it from the mid-day
and evening sun; trees rise on every side, and there is a break in
the hills, giving a lovely peep of the sea. The ground is dry
gravel; along the edge of the terrace runs a streamlet of water
from the fountain; and, near at hand, are some caves, which, if
cleaned out, would make commodious store-rooms, or would serve
other useful purposes. It is not, like the fountain, a place of
resort for the camels, oxen, goats, sheep, and Bedawin, in the
neighbourhood; and is free, therefore, from the dirt and insects
they leave behind them. Where I was, the wind is sometimes
disagreeable, raising clouds of dust which filled the tent; the
other spot is more sheltered, and even in high wind, is secure from
dust. If the traveller is accompanied by such a guide as Mohammed,
who spent all his time in buying beeves, let him be prepared to
have a hundred objections raised to the situation, as this place is
not convenient for such purchases—“<i>experto crede</i>.”</p>

<p>From the disagreeable experience I have had of the servants of
this country, I should advise travellers to bring with them all the
servants they may require, even to a groom, either Maltese, or what
is better still, Egyptians. Their ignorance of the roads is of
little consequence, as few of the Benghazi people are acquainted
with them; for guides it is better to trust the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span> camel-drivers: by doing so the
travellers will have servants who know their duty, and who, having
no private interests to serve in the country, fear not to displease
the people; Mohammed, serving his own, utterly neglected my
interests. Egyptian servants would not be more expensive than
Benghazini, and they have none of that overweening Moslem pride,
which makes the latter regard a Christian as something infinitely
beneath them.</p>

<p>There is one nuisance in Cyrene, too characteristic of the
country not to be mentioned. A small community of Derwishes, or
Marābuts, as they are called here, has established itself lately in
one of the largest tombs not far from the fountain. They belong to
an order recently founded by a reputed saint, called the Sheikh
Es-Senousy, and their president in Grennah is a fanatic of the
first water, who will not defile his eyes by even looking at a
Christian. He busily employed himself after my arrival here, in
impressing upon my servants the degradation of serving me. The
consequence was, that they all grew so uncivil—I must except the
cook—that I was at last obliged to change them. The groom—an eater
of pork and drinker of wine in the town—here missed none of the
five prayers; and, between the devotion of my servants and their
visitors, the encampment resounded all day long with “Allah akbar!”
I was glad to see so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
much religion among my people; but I could have wished it
productive of a little more civility.</p>

<p>Not content with giving such good lessons to the servants, his
saintship was, it seems, seriously annoyed by my presence here; and
particularly at my having once or twice passed before the cave
which he inhabits. He sent some of his people here, to say that, if
I or my Christian servant again passed before his door, he would
fire upon us; but Mohammed, who received the message, knew me too
well to deliver it. By chance, that same afternoon, whilst I was
engaged below, among some of the other tombs, my servant took this
path, little suspecting that he should thereby incur the holy man’s
displeasure. Two Arabs, armed with large stones, came to oblige him
to turn back; but he, luckily, had his gun in his hand, and they
consequently retreated. Next morning, I sent to Abou Bekr, to
complain of the insult offered to me, assuring him that not a day
should pass thenceforward without my taking the tabooed road. It
was too delicate a matter, it seems, for him to deal with directly,
the church assuming here, as elsewhere, a separate jurisdiction;
he, therefore, sent one of his sons to the superior of the chief
convent, with letters to request the punishment of the offenders.
Meantime, I kept my word, and, in going out in the evening, I took
this road; when I found an assemblage of some thirty Arabs, of all
ages, prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span> to bar
my passage. As I advanced quietly, they drew on one side, but as I
passed them, one small stone was thrown at, but missed me; on which
I turned, and, going straight among them, desired to know the name
of the fellow who had thrown the stone. This information, naturally
enough, I could not obtain from them; but I had seen the man who
threw the stone, remarking that he was more than ordinarily ugly;
I, therefore, threatened that I would have both him and them
punished.</p>

<p>The next day the offenders were brought before the great
Sheikh’s secretary—a man, I discovered, of good sense and
manners—who condemned them, with their superior, to fifty strokes
a-piece of his three-tailed courbaj—a punishment which was
immediately administered, and will not, I hope, be soon forgotten.
It was really necessary to enforce such punishment, however painful
to one’s own feelings; for lenity to these people, whose chief
intelligence lies in the soles of their feet, would only have
emboldened them to more serious attacks. The next day, Hamed, son
of Abou Bekr, arrived to enforce their superior’s orders on the
Derwishes; and he then came to pay me a visit, to make his father’s
excuses for not having returned mine; his soldiers, he said, were
busy collecting the miri, so that he could not assemble a
sufficient escort to enable him to come with safety.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span> This excuse, though strange, was
perfectly true, for, in fact, this Arab Sheikh and Bey could not
venture beyond the walls of his castle, even to his hareem, at the
distance of a bow-shot, without a guard. His visit, including the
dinner, did not occupy more than four hours, a very reasonable
visitation from an Arab. He seemed not wanting in intelligence; and
yet he could not, or would not, tell me the number of men under his
father’s jurisdiction, nor even the number of tribes. Indeed, he
appeared to have doubts as to the exact number of his ten brothers:
first, he said they were nine; then, on counting them all over on
his fingers, eleven, but he included himself. This son of a prince
of great comparative wealth—Abou Bekr being worth at least some
5000<em>l</em>. a year—the possessor of wives, and herds, and
flocks, wore a shirt as filthy as the Catholic Isabella’s, a cotton
skull-cap to match, a burneau far from clean, and a pair of
slippers as shabby and worn as the meanest Bedawy’s. At the end of
the visit, he told me he was badly off for soap, as his appearance
too plainly testified, and asked for a square, which, with not a
little grumbling, my servant gave him. Poor fellow! he has an
abscess in the side, which threatens him with consumption, unless
the favourite remedy for all inward complaints in this
country—burning with a hot iron—should effect a cure. He promised
to consult a medical man who is at Derna at<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_100">[100]</span> present; but I know that he will not do
so, for fear of having to pay for a consultation or the medicines.
The Arabs are fond enough of taking medicine when they can procure
it gratis, but to pay for it seems against their creed. When the
purse-strings are to be drawn, then they say, as he did, “Allah
houa es-shafry”—“God is the curer,” to which I answered him, by
completing the sentence, as it is inscribed over the pharmacy of
the Benfratelli in Rome, “<i>Nos remedium, Deus salutem</i>.”</p>

<p>The people of the country, when seriously ill, will go long
distances to obtain advice from a European doctor; but rather than
pay for the medicine he orders, they will hand over more than its
price to one of their Fikkehs for an amulet or an incantation.
These are the learned men generally employed as tutors, or
schoolmasters, or readers of the Koran. They ascribe all illnesses
to Satanic influence; and their exorcisms are directed to drive the
Devil out of the patient. I am somewhat incredulous as to this
origin of disease; but I confess that the cures they sometimes
perform are astonishing. When called to a sick person, they
generally begin by telling his friends that he has so many devils;
then, after a time, they will say only so many remain; and,
finally, after further exorcisms, not unaccompanied by an increased
honorary (no pay, no pater-noster), they sometimes<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span> really succeed in effecting a
perfect cure. Even Jews and Christians resort to them; and I heard
a well-authenticated instance from a medical man, who had himself
visited the patient, of a rheumatic fever cured in this way. On
this occasion the invalid was confined to bed, unable to move, and
his Fikkeh assured him he was held down by many devils. He,
therefore, after some prayers, belaboured them soundly with a
courbaj, to make them depart. The strokes intended for the devils,
naturally enough, made the patient also smart; and the pain of the
flogging exceeding, I suppose, that of the rheumatism, the sick man
at last started up to escape it, and the devils were declared to be
expelled; but next day they returned, when the Fikkeh was again
summoned, his remedy was again applied with undiminished energy,
and the man was really cured. Poor old Keate would have been as
great a Fikkeh in the East as he was in the West. Whilst I was in
Benghazi, a Jewish girl who had been mad for a long time, was
restored to her senses by one of these men; but on this occasion
only prayers and fumigations were used. I have not seen any of
these cures performed; but relying fully on the sources from which
I obtained my information, have no doubt of their truth; admitting
certain of the strange mental phenomena produced by so-called
animal magnetism, I do not see, indeed, why I need disbelieve
them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span> Whilst on the
subject of wonders, I may mention, that discoverers of stolen
property are not less frequently met with here than in Egypt; and
that they often succeed in indicating either the thief, or the
place where the missing goods are concealed, but never both, though
more frequently the latter than the former, which indicates pretty
clearly that their knowledge is to be attributed to the fears of
the culprit.</p>

<p class="csum">An Arab “Vendetta.” — Coquetry at the Wells. — A
Bridal Procession. — The Okbah Pass.</p>

<p class="nind"><em>September 12th</em>.—It was late in the day
before the camels which I had engaged to take my luggage to Derna
were ready, and much time was lost, even after a start was made,
before they were fairly in march. This is almost always the case
the first day of a journey with new camels, as their owners are
never content with the distribution of the luggage, each seeking to
lighten his own load at the expense of his fellows.</p>

<p>The road for an hour and a half follows the direction of Safsaf,
and then turning to the right proceeds over an undulating country,
from which, occasionally, ravines run down to the lower ground, and
in these the cedar or cypress trees afford a welcome shade. I have
already spoken of these trees, the universal ornament of this
country; but I must not omit to mention<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_104">[104]</span> that they are of a peculiar species. The
wood is of a pale yellowish colour, like that of the cypress, and
has the same perfume; but the tree itself assumes an infinity of
shapes, and in this respect is certainly the most beautiful that I
have ever seen. It rarely grows in the straight spiral form of the
common cypress; more frequently its branches stretch out at right
angles to the trunk, like the cedar of Lebanon, and sometimes it
assumes a parasol form, like the stone pine; but whatever its form,
it always throws a deep broad shade. At two hours and
three-quarters from Grennah are the ruins of a square fortalice;
these, and large heaps of squared stones in the neighbourhood,
marking the site of other buildings, seem to show that it was a
place of some size. Beneath the ruin is a well, called Labrak, in a
wide grassy plain, where some twenty years ago a bloody battle was
fought, which resulted in the establishment of my friend Abou
Bekr’s power, and in the total overthrow of the tribe of Beni
Hadhra, seven hundred of whom are said to be buried in this spot.
The remainder, with their chief, a cousin-german of the conqueror,
fled to Egypt, where they obtained a settlement in the Fazoum; but
they are ready to return the instant a chance of obtaining revenge
presents itself. This may not be distant, as the Bey has a feud
with another branch of his family, which feud the government of
Benghazi is endeavouring to put an<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_105">[105]</span> end to, but with small hopes of success,
his enemies having sworn, “by the divorce,” to destroy Abou Bekr or
leave the country. The continuance of his rule hardly seems
desirable, as both he and his son are accused of the wildest
excesses and basest meannesses of which Arabs can be guilty, in
addition to systematic oppression of the people. Our excellent
Vice-Consul in Derna told me that, a few days before my arrival,
one of the sons of my host of Cariab came to beg a little sugar of
him. He was then living in the Bazaar, and came to the Consul’s
residence outside the town, hoping thus to save himself the few
piastres, with which he could have bought what he wanted. These men
will ask for or take, according to circumstances, whatever they
see, were it only a scrap of cotton enough to make a skull-cap.</p>

<p>An hour and a quarter from Labrak lies Gabiout Younes, marked by
large ruins, among which are many arches; a large building which,
from its style, I thought Byzantine; and another, certainly
Saracenic, approached by a lofty arched gateway. This building is
composed of vaulted chambers, and was the first specimen of
Saracenic architecture I had met with, but it is entirely destitute
of other decoration than the beautiful light arch of the gateway.
Here, as in every spot where ancient buildings are found, are large
reservoirs. Only three-quarters of an hour further on are the
more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span> extensive
ruins called by the Arabs Tirt (like dirt), in the maps Tereth,
containing four castle-like buildings and many tombs. Two old
reservoirs serve as a Zavia, or habitation of Derwishes, of the
same order as my friends of Grennah, and I found here the largest
encampment of Bedawy (of the ’Ailet Ghaith) which I have yet seen.
They suffered me to wander about the ruins without molestation, but
showed no signs of friendliness—thanks, doubtless, to the
instructions of the Derwishes, who have been of late years very
active in these countries in spreading a feeling of hostility to
Christians. Northwards from the ruins extends a plain called Haou
el Zouz. From here, continuing nearly eastwards, in two hours and a
quarter we passed the ruins of Lamloudeh, formerly Limnis, covering
a large space of ground, but, as usual in this country, without a
trace of inscriptions. There is a tolerably preserved castle, which
seems to have received at a period long subsequent to its erection
an additional fortification in a sloping embankment, some eight
feet high, of small unsquared stones piled against the walls. Here,
and at Tirt, I remarked large numbers of round and oval flat stones
hollowed on one side to a depth of about six inches, with a square
hole in the centre. Excepting one which lies flat and, I think, in
its original position, all the others are sticking upright in the
ground. They are more like mill-stones than anything<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span> else; but, besides some of
them being oval, their size is so large, varying from forty-five to
sixty inches in diameter, and their number is so great, that I can
hardly think this their original destination. There is to be seen
in Rome a stone called the “Bocca della verità” which has nearly
the same form as these; it was the mouth of a sewer, according to
the general account, and perhaps these stones may have served as
the covers of cisterns; but I found none connected with any
existing excavation. The ruins are built on the side of a hill and
contain many arches, all bearing the impress of the Roman period.
Beneath the town lay four very large reservoirs connected with each
other, partly cut in the rock, partly built. A little to the east
is a subterraneous passage, now very much choked up, which the
Arabs pretend communicates with the citadel, and near it are many
broken sarcophagi and cave tombs, as far as I was able to see, all
devoid of ornament.</p>

<p>From Lamloudeh the road passes through a beautiful wood of
arbutus, over long low hills, which, leaving Zimah to the right,
gradually descend into a plain, watered by two fountains, which is
called the Kubbeh. The stream issues in considerable volume from
the rock, in front of which still stands a portico (El Kubbeh)
supported by five (formerly eight) square pillars. In front the
ground is covered with<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_108">[108]</span> remains of buildings apparently connected
with the fountain, and the rocks behind contain a great many large
tombs, as well as a flight of steps leading to the ground above.
Round the fountain I found large flocks of sheep and goats, with
their shepherds, who were busy drawing water, with which they
filled troughs formed of stones taken from the old buildings; women
also, who, with their donkeys, had come for the supply of water
required for their households. Here I seated myself on the top of
the portico, in the shade of the rock, against which it is built,
waiting for my camels to come up, and found amusement enough in
watching the coquetries of the ladies and the awkward gallantries
of the men. The well is still, as in the days of Rebecca, the place
for flirtations. The filling two skins and tying them on the donkey
were so adroitly managed, that, with many words and much laughter,
the men seeming to aid, but really impeding the operation, at least
two hours were consumed at the well. The Bedawin, as I have already
said, are very sparing in their use of water, their bread even
being generally made with milk, so that the visits to the wells,
often at a great distance, are only made once in three or four
days. Whilst I sat on the Kubbeh, a wedding party conducting a
bride to her husband came in sight, and for two hours I had the
amusement of watching them, as it is a point of honour to
consume<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span> the whole
day on the road from the bride’s house to her husband’s tent; and
as this was at no great distance, and the Kubbeh a sort of public
place, it took the party two hours to go over a space which I rode
along in five minutes. The bride was invisible, shut up in an
arched box called a carmout, placed on a camel, the centre part or
arch covered with black hair-cloth, the ends with white cotton, the
housings of the camel being also of a dark colour. The cortège
consisted of six horsemen (among whom were neither her father nor
her husband), several men, and eight or ten women on foot. At every
hundred paces the procession stopped, the women raised the wild cry
of rejoicing called Zaghazhit, and some of the men performed a sort
of awkward dance in front of the camel, which ended with a
discharge of guns. Whilst in sight they once varied the
entertainment with a mimic fight, when there was much waste of
powder, and once, on a level piece of ground, the horsemen gave
chase to each other, the only graceful feature in their sports.
Then, with a fresh burst of the Zaghazhit from the ladies, the
procession moved on. From what I hear of the fair sex in this
country, they do not seem to have much degenerated from the
reputation which Herodotus has given to their predecessors the
Gindanes. Of course I am unwilling to believe all the
scandalous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span> tales
which were told me, but the existence of such stories seems to
prove that irregularities, unknown or carefully concealed in other
Mussulman countries, here excite little attention. Divorces are
frequent, but they arise most frequently from the caprice of the
men, and, far from being considered disgraceful to the lady, many
persons prefer those who have already made the happiness of second
husbands to inexperienced maidens, as their successive dowers, paid
in full at each divorce, frequently make them, for the country,
wealthy. The usual <i>corbeil</i> given to a bride consists of four
rotoli of silver, half a rotolus of gold, and some pieces of stuff
for dresses. Only a part of the metal is in general paid down, the
remainder a debt due, in case of divorce, to the lady, or, in case
of her death, to her heirs, that is, her children, or, if she have
left none, to her family.</p>

<p>To the north of El-Kubbeh, not in the direct road to Derna, lies
Messakit, where are some curious caves, one of them containing
rudely-carved emblems, of Christian origin. A gently-undulating
plain leads eastward to Beit Thamr, near which are many
excavations, one of them evidently part of a country house, where
the apparatus for pressing oil is still to be seen, hewn in the
living rock. This is one of the places where bees are reared in
great numbers, for the sake<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_111">[111]</span> principally of their wax. Our English bees
would, perhaps, rebel, if one attempted to house them in the long
wooden boxes, which here supply the place of the elegant and
commodious habitations they are accustomed to; but their fellows of
the Cyrenaica, though less pampered, produce larger supplies of
wax, and the honey almost vies in flavour with that of Hymettus.
After passing Beit Thamr, the road enters a valley, called Brouk,
filled with small streams, the last which are met with till close
upon Derna. Above, on the heights, are ruins of a castle, and along
the valley many excavations, one of which, containing a fountain,
has a number of niches, as if for votive offerings or statues. Here
the road begins to ascend through a beautiful wooded country,
affording cover to numbers of the red-legged partridge, of which we
started whole coveys at every turn. The grave of a Marābut, called
Sidi Yadem, on the top of this ridge, was our sleeping place. From
this point to the summit of the steep descent which leads to the
coast, is a journey of four hours and a half, over rising grounds,
affording, in the breaks of the hills, occasional glimpses of the
sea; and on the heights are many remains of ruined fortalices. The
descent, called the Okbah, though certainly steep, is not the
fearful pass which it has been described; and in all this journey I
never had occasion, from the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_112">[112]</span> badness of the road, to dismount from
horseback. In the last years, I believe something has been done to
improve this piece of road, which may be considered good by any one
who is acquainted with the passes of the Lebanon.</p>

appearance. — Ruined Battery. — Curious Bargain.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">From</span> the summit of the
Okbah one looks down upon a long line of coast, the view extending
to the promontory Ras el Hilal (Nausthasmus) on the left, and
eastward to the Ras el Tin. The hills which run along the sea-line
to the right are barren sandstone; the coast, a line of low rocks;
and from this point Derna is only just visible, as a dark spot on
the sea-shore in the midst of glaring sands. It took an hour to
descend from this height to the more level ground; and the intense
heat reflected from the sandy soil, where not a shrub affords the
slightest shade, made this the least pleasant three hours’ ride I
had yet had in this country. Neither well nor fountain is met with
in this day’s march till about an hour from Derna, where a brackish
spring issues from the rock, and flows directly into the sea, in a
situation where it is difficult<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_114">[114]</span> to find it. At length, after ascending a
low hill of sand, which had hitherto bounded the view ahead, the
green gardens of Derna relieve the eye, lying between the foot of
bare rocky hills and the sea. Here I was most kindly received by
the English Vice-Consul, Mr. Aquilina, whose ready hospitality I
with difficulty declined, being unwilling to inflict the presence
of strange servants on his establishment. Through his kindness I
was soon put in possession of a garden, where I pitched my tent
under the shade of its palms and fig-trees. Though we had not
before met, I was already indebted to this gentleman for many of
the attentions shown me while at Grennah; and during my stay here I
derived from him much valuable information—the result of his
thirteen years’ residence among them—regarding the people of the
country and their governors.</p>

<p>Leo Africanus, in the sixth book of his “Description of Africa,”
gives an account of the poverty of the inhabitants of Barca, and
tells how they were in the habit of bartering their children for
corn with the merchants of Sicily. The spontaneous fertility and
pastoral wealth of the country, as I saw it, seemed to contradict
this account, though the general fidelity of the author inclined me
to place almost implicit belief in him. In Derna I afterwards
learned, that his description, instead of exceeding, falls far
short of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> the truth
during the seasons when the country is desolated by one of those
blights which occur at uncertain periods. The Arabs of
Gebel-el-Achdar are among the least provident people in the world;
and when a reverse befalls them, are one and all, the poor and the
wealthy, reduced to the greatest straits. When the crops are
abundant, everything becomes dear, labour can be obtained on no
terms, the Arab refuses to sell either his cattle or flocks, he
buys slaves and horses at any price, and setting his cap on one
side, spends all his time in riding and gormandising. But sometimes
a flight of locusts descends upon the country, and in a few hours
every blade of corn or grass, and every leaf, have disappeared; or
successive years of drought wither up the crops, and then, no
provender remaining for the cattle, the wells are exhausted, and
pestilence, which spares neither man nor beast, follows hard upon
the scarcity and the drought. Then, though too late, the Arab is as
anxious to sell all he has at any price he can obtain, as he was
before hard in his dealings and careless of reasonable gain. He
eats the corn reserved for seed, and when the rains at length
descend to fecundate the country, the fields remain unsown. Such a
visitation came upon them some eight years ago. Their cattle, the
great wealth of the country, died for want of food; the next year
there was no grain for sowing, and then the misery<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> was so terrible that it would
require the pen of a Defoe to describe it. The strongest guard was
insufficient to insure the safety of the traveller in such a
season; misery rendered the people desperate, so that it seemed
easier to them to die in combat than by the slow agony of want.
Parents sold their children literally for a few measures of barley:
a very pretty girl was offered to one of my acquaintance for two
dollars; and I know some persons who, through pure compassion,
bought children at this price. The dying were devoured even before
life was extinct; and in the ravings of hunger, as eye-witnesses
have related to me, the poor wretches would gnaw the thighs and
arms of those who, more reduced than themselves, were too weak to
defend themselves. Thousands emigrated into Egypt, and hundreds of
them died of exhaustion on the road thither.</p>

<p>We read in antiquity, even in the flourishing days of the
empire, of terrible famines in this country; but these, doubtless,
were alleviated by the resources of the other provinces. Though
again subject to an extensive empire, the country can now look for
no such assistance when these disasters fall upon it. The duty of
the provinces is, to send yearly subsidies to the capital; that of
the Government is, to send rapacious satraps to enrich themselves
by the spoils of the people, and to stifle their complaints.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>The town of
Derna is composed of four villages—Upper and Lower Derna, and Upper
and Lower Bou Mansour, the former separated from the two latter
villages by a broad, stony wady, which in winter forms the bed of
one of the two streams whose abundant waters, diverted by a former
governor into many channels, flow through all the streets, and are
at regular periods distributed to the different gardens in which
the houses of the town are situated. These many streams of water,
and the gardens from which rise thousands of splendid palms, rich
in the bright green of the banana and the reddening leaf of the
vine, give this place a strong resemblance to some of the villages
on the outskirts of Damascus, a resemblance which is still further
increased by the arid barrenness of the hills above and of the
surrounding country. Unfortunately this luxuriant vegetation, as
too often happens in these lands, is accompanied by periodical
fevers, dysentery, and ophthalmia, which the sea-breezes seem to
have no effect in preventing. An old castle, now in ruins, which
once commanded the town from the hill above, and the lanes which
lead to it, overarched, as they are, with verdure, through which
the rays of the sun pierce in chequered patches, form a most
picturesque scene. The whole town has an air of prosperity far
surpassing that of Benghazi, though its population, about 4500
souls, is smaller, and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_118">[118]</span> its trade is comparatively insignificant.
It consists principally in exports of wax, great quantities of
which are produced in the neighbouring country, occasional cargoes
of cattle for Malta, and sheep, which are yearly sent in vast
flocks by land a journey of thirty-five days to Alexandria.
Antiquarian remains are few, Darnis having been a place of not the
slightest importance until about the fourth century: they consist
of some traces of the ancient port at the western extremity of the
town, a Roman gateway, and some excavations in the hills.</p>

<p>Derna has no harbour. From September to January its roadstead is
sufficiently secure, but after this month no ship can anchor there
in safety, as it is entirely exposed to the north and east winds,
which then blow with great fury. There is, to the east of the town,
a point where the shore makes a bend, on which may be seen a ruined
battery, with half a dozen dismounted guns; it serves as a monument
to record the fact that this place was held by the Americans, for a
short period, about thirty years ago.<a id=
"FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
Probably the difficulty<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_119">[119]</span> of making a harbour (they had planned an
excavated basin in the wady which separates Derna from Bou
Mansour), as well as the traditional policy of their country,
always opposed to distant settlements, decided them to abandon the
place.</p>

<p>I spent a very pleasant fortnight in Derna, encamped<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> within reach of the sea-spray
when the winds blew strong; but before I left I began to experience
that feeling of discomfort which malaria is apt to give when it
does not produce fever; and, notwithstanding the beauty of the
place, and the attentions of Mr. Aquilina and his family, I was
glad to find myself once more on the heights of the Okbah.</p>

<p><em>October</em> 1.—I returned to Ain-esh-Shehad nearly by the
same route which I had followed in coming to Derna, and there I
spent ten days in revisiting some of the most beautiful spots in
its neighbourhood, and in the enjoyment of the pure light air of
its hills. I had left a part of my baggage in the charge of one of
the Arabs of the place; and though the eatables must have been
tempting, I had not to complain of any great indiscretion in his
visits to my sacks. Though my neighbours were fanatical, I had, on
the whole, no reason to be dissatisfied with them; with the
exception of the Marābut and his pupils, they gave me very little
trouble, and their thefts were confined to articles of trifling
value. I had got rid of my friend Mohammed at Derna, with the
servants, children, and horses which he had quartered upon me, so
that there was no longer a daily fair held round my tents; and thus
the last days I spent at Grennah were among the most agreeable of
my residence there.</p>

<p>The advancing autumn, the threatening clouds<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> which now overshadowed the
sky, and the increasing cold of the nights, warned me not to
prolong my stay; and with regret I tore myself from a place where I
had spent two quiet months so pleasantly, and, as far as health at
least was concerned, so profitably. I find among my notes of these
last days mention made of a curious bargain, which was struck in my
presence; it was the sale of half a mare. The price of the entire
animal was fixed at a certain sum, half of which was paid down by
the purchaser, who took possession of the mare, which he was bound
to keep in good condition. The foals were to be joint property, and
the original proprietor could at any time have the use of the mare,
or, by repaying the purchase-money, again become her sole
proprietor. This is a common transaction; and as a fourth, or even
a smaller fraction of a mare may be thus sold, some have many
masters, and serious quarrels often arise from such joint
possession.</p>

<p>It was not without many a long look that I rode away from the
fountain towards the western gate of the town and the street of
Tombs, which I have described as the old road to Barca. I was now
on my return to Benghazi, not by the road I had taken in July, but
with the intention, after visiting Nurdj, of following the coast by
Dolmeita and Tokra.</p>

<p class="csum">Convent Agriculture. — A Roman Stronghold. —
Splendid Olive Groves. — Water runs short. — The Mirage. — Dine
with the Governor. — The Site of Ancient Barca. — Quit the plain of
Merdj.</p>

<p><em>October 10th.</em>—The old road, with its deep-worn ruts,
from time to time reappears among the underwood, and its course is
marked for a great distance from the city by groups of broken
sarcophagi and excavated tombs. In four hours and a half, pursuing
a W.S.W. direction, we reached a beautiful hilly country, with fine
old caroub trees and numerous ruins. Here is the chief Zavia, or
convent of the Senoosy Marābuts, called Sidi Rafa’a; it is still in
course of erection, and is a stately building for the country. The
neighbouring ruins supply the materials for the building; and, by
good luck, I arrived while the extensive foundations of a very
large temple, which they were digging up to employ in building the
convent chapel, were still traceable. The masonry of the
substructures, consisting of passages or underground<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> chambers, was formed of very
large stones, squared and cemented with remarkably white lime. The
lintel of a doorway, of very good chiselling, and a part of a
fluted pilaster, were all I could discover of the architecture. Its
situation, in respect of its distance from Cyrene, and the extent
of its ruins, leave no doubt in my mind that here was the site of
Balaerai and its great Temple of Æsculapius. Its position on the
summit of a slight elevation is lovely; the remains of many other
buildings, some of them not insignificant, cover the ground all
around. I should have expected to find a fountain of medicinal
waters near a Temple of Æsculapius (no trace of which is to be
found here), yet none such is mentioned by old writers, nor could I
hear of any place in this direction, or elsewhere at a similar
distance from Cyrene, where such waters exist.</p>

<p>On either side, the country here exhibited signs of more
laborious agriculture than I had yet seen in any other part; the
underwood had been in great part cleared away, and the fields were
black with ashes of burned weeds and brushwood, spread over the
ground as manure, preparatory to sowing. The secret of this
unwonted industry is the possession of the country by a religious
order who, here as elsewhere, spare no effort to turn the property
which they have acquired (partly by purchase, but more largely by
donations)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> to good
account. In this way they may exercise here the same beneficial
influence over husbandry which, during the middle ages, the
religious orders exerted in Europe; they are also active in giving
a sort of Bible-Society education (instruction in reading the
Koran) to the children in the neighbourhood of their dwellings.
Unfortunately, however, it is only in these points that they
emulate the Christian institution to which I have compared them;
for with the elements of learning they instil into the youthful
minds of their pupils feelings of hatred and contempt for the
professors of every creed which differs from their own—a creed very
alien from the practice of Christian charity.</p>

<p>Two hours further on is a fountain with ruins around it, and on
a hill opposite many tombs. The place is called Belandsh, and its
waters fertilise some gardens which are cultivated by Arabs, who
live in the numerous excavations of the neighbourhood. When I left
Derna the grape season was long over; in Grennah, on my return, not
a cluster remained on the few vines grown by the Bedawin: here, I
bought white grapes, with which the trellises were loaded, and
which were not yet ripe. Herodotus speaks of the three climates of
the Cyrenaica, in consequence of which the harvest is carried on
during eight months of the year; and it was interesting to meet
with this practical confirmation of his remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>From Belandsh
the road runs for many hours through a country thickly strewed with
shapeless ruins and sarcophagi, the hill-sides being almost
everywhere burrowed by excavations. Just before reaching a spring
called Maten Ma’as, two hours from the last, is a ruined castle, to
which the people of the neighbourhood have given the name of Kasr
Djemal. It seems to have been originally a Roman stronghold, added
to or repaired in Saracenic times. Riding in a N.W. direction from
this place, along an ancient road, I reached in an hour and ten
minutes (horse-pace), a fine old castle on a hill to the left. On a
square base of rock, formed by an excavated ditch fourteen feet
wide, rises a square tower, which, with the exception of one
vaulted chamber, still entire, is filled with fallen rubbish. In
addition to the ditch, very extensive outworks, which are still to
be traced on all sides, formed its defences: it is now called Sirt
Nawara. That it must have been a place of some importance may be
conjectured, not only from its position, but also from the many
tombs in its neighbourhood, and the carefully-chiselled decorations
of many of their façades. I here found that I had missed the road,
which takes a turn more to the south, and, consequently, had to
ride back to Maten Ma’as, and thence over a range of low hills,
which afforded little shade, and were very hot, being screened, by
a higher range to the north, from<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_126">[126]</span> the sea-breezes. This road, however, led,
after two hours’ travelling, to a succession of the most beautiful
scenes I ever beheld, even in this beautiful country. A steep
ravine forms the descent from the high ground which we had now
reached, surrounded on either side by lofty rocks, in some places
perpendicular, while in others they slant sufficiently to allow an
accumulation of mould on their slope. Down this the path winds over
fallen rocks, among venerable olive trees and gigantic cypresses,
which grow up among the <i>débris</i> in the bottom of the valleys,
while the receding hills are thickly covered with junipers and
olives. This valley, if cultivated, might produce annually an
almost unlimited quantity of oil: it took me nearly three hours to
ride through it. The trees are probably self-planted, and,
doubtless, the descendants of those which supplied the old Cyrenian
commerce with the oil for which it was so famous: they were covered
with an abundance of fruit. No care is bestowed upon them; many are
rather immense bushes than trees, and their valuable produce serves
only as food for the goats, which eat the fruit greedily as it
falls. In the hands of a speculator possessing capital, an enormous
profit might no doubt be obtained in the course of three or four
years, by the cultivation of these trees; all they require is
pruning, and to have the earth collected round their roots, in
order to give a splendid harvest.<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_127">[127]</span> The trees are not the wild olive species,
though their fruit is small. Not even in Italy have I seen a
country apparently so well adapted to the cultivation of the olive;
but the uncertainty of tenure of property, the deplorable weakness
of the Government, and the untamed savageness of the Arabs of the
neighbourhood, would certainly render the speculation a hazardous
one.</p>

<p>The name of this lovely scene is Aggher bi Haroubeh. On a hill
to the left, on emerging from the ravine, is seen the Castle of
Benigdem, the best preserved of the old forts which are met with
everywhere in the Cyrenaica. It is a rectangular oblong building,
with two square towers slightly advancing from the line of the
wall, in the centres of the longer sides. One of these towers is
still in great part perfect, having three stories of windows. The
second story is vaulted, and has on each side two windows looking
outwards. The walls are built double, of stones carefully squared
both within and without, leaving a space filled in with rubble,
thus increasing the thickness and strength at little expense. I
have remarked that the same method of building is employed in many
of the old forts in this neighbourhood, and also further south. On
the north side, a low arched gateway, commanded from the tower,
seems to have been the only entrance to the fort, which was further
defended by a low outwork, built of squared stones,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> still easily traced. The
interior is now so filled with the ruins of fallen walls, that it
is impossible to distinguish its arrangement. Hence, I rode on
through the hills to another old fortalice of very small
dimensions, where I slept. The distance from Maten Ma’as to this
place, for which I could learn no name, is eight hours of camel
travelling. The tents were pitched among hills of great beauty,
covered with wood, overlooking a rich plain, through which runs the
lower road from Grennah to Merdj. This we followed the next day;
and during ten hours of travelling, the country presented a
succession of richly-wooded scenery, frequented by innumerable
covies of partridges. This day, five hours after starting, I made a
detour to the right through a long winding valley, which leads
towards the coast, through the country of the Dirsah Arabs, but did
not meet with any ruins of importance. The camel-drivers took
advantage of my absence to journey on to a later hour than I
usually travelled; the process of pitching the tents and preparing
dinner being very much impeded after sunset. They were, however,
disappointed in their hopes of reaching water; and we had now
travelled two days without finding any. The skins had all been
filled; but, during the first day, with the ordinary recklessness
of Arabs, they had drunk a large part of our provision, and there
would have been none left for the evening,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_129">[129]</span> had not my servant taken possession of the
last remaining skin, so as to secure it for the evening meal. In
consequence of this, there was great suffering from thirst among my
followers. The Arabs here are not abstemious, for they drink water
in enormous quantities whenever they can get it, and when they
cannot thus indulge their thirst, they seem to suffer very much. My
own rule in drinking is to take a cup of coffee in the middle of
the day, rarely adding a small cup of water, flavoured with raki,
to destroy any insects it may contain. I make a practice of not
drinking at other times during the journey; and I do this both from
finding the advantage of such abstinence, and for the sake of
example to the servants, in a country where water is sometimes so
precious. The day following there was of course great haste to
reach the wells, which the evening before, when I stopped them, the
camel-drivers represented as close at hand. I rode on through an
open country, anxious to obtain water for the horses, which had not
drunk for two days; but it took three hours and a half to reach the
Wady el Gharib, at the upper end of which are many wells. When at
last I reached them, we had no means of drawing the water; and some
Arabs, who were watering their sheep there, absolutely refused, for
love or money, according to their own expression, to supply us.
They were only five in number; and I had great<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_130">[130]</span> difficulty in persuading my servant
(though he had only the previous evening wounded his right hand so
as to make it useless), not to take possession of the well by
force. This would have been easy enough, but after my complaints
against the marābut at Grennah, I was anxious to preserve a good
character for peaceable conduct. It took the camels nearly an hour
and a half longer to reach the wells; and not doubting that, on
seeing the number of the party, the Arabs would yield us a supply,
at least enough for the horses, I possessed my soul in patience in
the interval. When at last they came up, I acknowledge that, in my
heart, I was not well pleased to see my people quietly submit to be
refused accommodation by the Arabs, without taking forcible
possession of their cord and bucket; but, true to my system, I kept
the Sultan’s peace, and contented myself, when the caravan had
moved on, with riding down to them, and assuring them that I should
have them punished, having in the meantime found out their names.
The Governor of Merdj, on my complaint, promised they should be
sent for and punished; and to make sure of his having kept his
word, I renewed my complaint, through the English Consul, to the
Bey of Benghazi. These Arabs belonged to the tribe of Abid, whom I
have already mentioned as notorious for their predatory habits and
discourtesy to strangers. From the well we rode on<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> for five hours, in hopes of
reaching Merdj that evening; but an hour after sunset, when we had
climbed a steep wooded hill, we found that we were still only on
the edge of the vast plain thus named. It was already dark; on all
sides a hundred fires marked the dwellings of the Bedawin, who
encamp here in great numbers for the convenience of the wells, of
which there are in all upwards of forty around the castle. I sent a
camel for water, but it was midnight before it returned; so that we
were in some discomfort, no cooking having been possible, though I
found an unhoped for consolation in my nargila, in filling which a
servant had stupidly used the last drop of our water. The next
morning, starting early, it took the camels four hours to reach the
Medina, as the part of the plain on which the newly-erected castle
is built, is called. In the maps, two large lakes are marked as
existing in this locality, and before us, immediately in front of
the castle, lay an immense expanse of clear water, unruffled by a
breath of air, and every object on its banks reflected in it, as if
in a mirror. It receded as we approached, and at length disappeared
altogether; but on turning round, I saw my camels, which followed
at a considerable distance, wading up to their knees in the magic
fluid. I had often seen the mirage in the Desert, where it is of
frequent occurrence, but the deception was much less real. Here,
for some time, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
had no suspicion that the lake, round which I contemplated a long
detour in the hot sun with no pleasant feelings, would vanish on
coming nearer. These lakes, which make a formidable appearance on
the map, really exist sometimes for years together; they owe their
origin entirely to the autumnal or winter rains, and dry up after
two or three seasons of drought, such as of the preceding years. On
approaching the castle, in front of which lie the greater number of
the wells, the scene presented to us was the most primitively
pastoral I had ever witnessed. Immense herds and flocks, collected
in groups, covered a very large space, while boys and women were
busily engaged in drawing water, which they poured into skins
stretched on hoops, for the cattle to drink from. Many short trunks
of columns are placed near each other triangularly, so as to
support the edges of the hoops, while the skins form a basin. The
sun was very hot, and the earth here is of a red colour; and,
though not yet midday, the air, from these causes, seemed to have
that warm tone which we admire in some of Both’s evening
landscapes.</p>

<p>I rode at once to the castle, after procuring water for my
horses from one of the fair Rebeccas at the wells, and was very
kindly received by the Kehia or Governor. The ill-lighted, cool
council-room to which he conducted me, empty of everything but the
divan at one end, was most refreshing after exposure<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> to the fiery heat of the
plain. Dinner was almost immediately afterwards served, and I sat
down with him, the commandant of the few soldiers stationed here,
and half-a-dozen Arabs, whom he summoned by name from the door.
When dinner had been dispatched, the only term applicable to Arab
eating, I remarked a custom which had on other occasions struck me.
Of those who had dipped their hands in the same dishes with us, all
went out after washing except my host, the commandant, and one of
the Arabs, who was specially invited to stay: after their departure
coffee was served. I remember having heard a story from one of the
most spiritual of my friends, which is applicable to the case in
point. Several years ago he spent some time at one of the smaller
German courts, where the number of the rules of etiquette is in the
inverse ratio to the numbers of the population. For many days one
of his neighbours at dinner—a most agreeable and well-informed
man—regularly left the room when the <i>rôti</i> was served, making
a low bow in rising from his place. His departure did not at first
attract my friend’s attention, but as the same scene occurred
daily, he at length turned to his other neighbour and asked him the
meaning of it; expecting to hear that the man had an aversion to
roast meat, such as some people have<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_134">[134]</span> to cats. The answer was simply, “Herr N.
ist nicht bratenfähig;” that is, Herr N. may sup his soup, and
enjoy the entrées and relevés, but he is not well born enough to
partake of roast beef in this company. Thus any Arab may with
propriety enjoy the Bey’s good dinner, but he must not hope to
drink his coffee after it. A similar custom seems once to have
existed in England. In Shadwell’s “Lancashire Witches,” Sir Timothy
says to his uncle, “What a murrain do we keep you for, but to sit
at the lower end of the board at meals, rise, make a leg, and take
away your plate at second course.”</p>

<p>The site of the castle, surrounded by many fragments of ancient
buildings, is that of Barca, daughter and rival of Cyrene, and even
under the Arab domination (long after the parent city was a heap of
ruins), a flourishing town. The ground is literally strewn with
fragments of small columns, the ruins of the Saracenic city, and
the line of its walls is still distinctly traceable. The castle,
which was only begun a year ago, on the site of the ancient
citadel, is built of ancient materials dug up on the spot. Many
capitals of columns, of debased Greek workmanship, and many entire
columns, have been found in digging out materials for its
construction, but nothing dating even as far back as the time of
the Ptolemies. I found the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_135">[135]</span> base of a column, of white marble, lying
among the rubbish, which had formerly been a cube, having on four
of its sides Greek inscriptions. Judging from the form of the
letters which remain, I should suppose them to be of about the
first century of our era; but it was not possible to decipher the
meaning of the inscription, as each line was more than half effaced
on the side which has been turned downwards, and only single
letters of each line remained on two other sides. In its present
condition it may be of the fourth or fifth century. Cufic
inscriptions are not unfrequently discovered here; one, lately
found, had been placed above the door of the council-room, but was
so thickly whitewashed as to be quite illegible. Two capitals of
columns, in white marble, with the Moslem profession of faith
beautifully inscribed round each in raised flowered letters, had
just been built into the sides of the minbar of a mosque which the
Kehia is building, one of the capitals being turned upside down. He
begged me to go to see the progress of the work, to assure him, by
means of the compass, if the Kibleh was rightly placed, and this
gave me an opportunity of seeing the simple, or rather rude,
fashion in which the light arches are thrown from pillar to pillar.
There was no scaffolding used beyond two planks for the mason to
stand on, neither was there any wooden<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_136">[136]</span> centering, but the stones, cut to the
proper shape, were, one after another, handed up to the mason, who
secured them in their places with cement; a few loose stones were
made to support them: the arch being thus gradually built up from
each side, the keystone was at last added, and then the planks were
immediately removed, the arch being considered solid enough to
require no further care. The arches were pointed, and each composed
of eleven or thirteen stones. In another building, intended for an
oil-press, I found a large circular arch, twenty feet in width, in
process of erection. Here a long board had been run across the
breadth of the building; in its centre a nail served as a pivot for
a long strip of pointed wood, by which the mason decided the
position of each stone as he placed it. There were several small
houses in progress, destined to form the nucleus of a town, which
the Kehia hopes to see rebuilt. This was the only place in the
whole country where I had seen anything like enterprise. The Kehia
is a clever man, and, in conjunction with the Bey of Benghazi,
whose dependant he is, he had undertaken these works in hopes of
making a profitable speculation out of the oil of the uncultivated
olive trees in the neighbourhood. It was with a sincere wish for
his success, which cannot fail to be followed by increased industry
and gradual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
civilisation of the district, that I took leave of him, having
spent two days in the Medina, during both of which the hot south
wind had blown with great force, raising clouds of red dust. It was
the first time I had experienced this wind in the Cyrenaica.</p>

blasts which swept, stifling, over the plain of Merdj, I started,
though late in the afternoon, on the way to Tolmeta. The camel
drivers, who had been furnished to me at Grennah by Abou Bekr, in
addition to their ignorance of the road, proved themselves the most
unmanageable beings I had yet met with; having complained of them
to the Kehia, he gave them an admonition, and also provided me with
an Arab of the country, a soi-disant relation, to conduct me on my
way.</p>

<p>It took three hours in a north-east direction to reach the edge
of the plain, when, night coming on, I encamped, and continued the
journey the following morning. There are two ravines which lead
towards Tolmeta, of which we took the one to the west,
called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span> Wady
Shebbah; this route is rather the longer of the two, but affords an
easy descent, which, to travellers with heavily-laden camels, is a
consideration of no little moment. The other descent was called by
my conductor Wady Hambes, or Hambesh. It is described by Beechey as
very beautiful, and, being more difficult, its scenery is probably
grander than that of the route followed by me, which is rather a
pass than a ravine, running over long low hills until it gradually
reaches the level of the sea. On the shore, nearly opposite its
<i>débouché</i>, is a group of rocks, and among them a well with
brackish water, where we found many goats, with their attendants.
From this, riding eastward, we came to another well, and then to a
third in the ruins of a fortalice, which contains the only sweet
water in the neighbourhood. Having filled our water-bottles, we
went on to a large square monument, supposed to be the tomb of one
of the Ptolemies who reigned in this country; the monument is
visible to a great distance out at sea. Built on a square base of
rock, it presents a noble mass, and has kindled the enthusiasm of
former visitors; but, to my eye, excepting for its greater
dimensions, it seemed in architectural beauty inferior to many I
have seen elsewhere in this country. The triangular entrance, on
the side opposite to the hills, is remarkable from its resemblance
to that of the Great Pyramid. Near this are<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_140">[140]</span> many large excavated tombs, one of which
is remarkable, from the fact that the rock out of which it is
fashioned has been cut away all round, and thus a monolithic
monument, in the truest sense, produced. It took seven and a half
hours in all from Merdj to this point, where I stayed for upwards
of an hour, in the useful, or at least necessary, employment of
bargaining for sheep, a flock of which was drinking at a pool in
front of the large tower. All bargains are difficult negotiations
in this country, the Arabs often refusing to sell at a price less
than double the market value of their merchandise: they are well
acquainted with the laudable custom of making strangers pay their
way. The price of sheep appeared to have gradually risen since I
came into the country; the first I bought cost me about five
shillings, and those I bought here more than double that sum. For a
party of six people I found that, with economy, a sheep would last
three days, if eked out with a not inconsiderable supply of rice
and biscuits for the Arabs, who eat voraciously.</p>

<p>With my new friend, Abd-el-Kader Waled Ali, I had much curious
conversation, as I found him more communicative than the greater
part of his countrymen. He is of the wealthier class, and lives in
the country beyond Labiar. He complained, and I believe with
justice (for every one I have spoken with on the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> subject confirmed what he
said), of the unequal manner in which the taxes are levied, the
miri for each naga varying in different tribes from five to six
hundred piastres. The naga, like the pound sterling, is an
imaginary unit, consisting of ten camels, or twenty oxen, or a
hundred sheep or goats. Each tribe pays tribute for a certain
number of nagas, according to a census made some 150 years ago; the
Sheikh being responsible for its partition among the members of his
tribe, and its collection. It is easy to understand that with such
a system the tax falls very heavily on those tribes which from war
or other causes have sunk in importance in this lapse of time;
whilst, on the other hand, those which have grown wealthy pay an
insignificant sum: thus a tribe rated at a hundred nagas, and which
has now only twenty, pays for each naga five times the sum it was
originally taxed at; while those whose wealth has increased from a
hundred to a thousand, pay for each only a fiftieth part of what
their less fortunate neighbours are charged. Ignorant in book
learning, the Arabs, aided by their rosaries, are no mean
proficients in arithmetic; and their applications for redress are
as incessant as fruitless. From what I have seen of the country a
spirit of discontent is universal—the Arabs regret their old
independent pasha; and I think the arrival of any Government,
Moslem or even Christian—so<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_142">[142]</span> only not the Sultan’s—would be hailed with
general satisfaction.</p>

<p>Abd-el-Kader is married, and I took down his account of the
price he paid for his wife. To her father he gave thirteen sheep,
valued at two dollars and a half each, with a hundred dollars in
cash; and to the lady herself, a pair of silver bracelets (souar or
debalg), weighing thirty-five dollars, dress-stuffs to the same
amount, furniture, carpets, &amp;c., to the value of fifty dollars;
these, with some other expenses, made the cost of his wedding
amount in all to three hundred dollars. He confirmed to me the
truth of an Arab custom, which I had before heard of from others,
that of giving to the mother, of the bride a sum varying from a
hundred to five hundred piastres, as the price of the milk with
which she had suckled her daughter. The sheep and the money are not
returned in any shape, as, on her father’s death, his wife’s
brother succeeds to them, and on his death the next male heir.
“Well,” I said, “you will acknowledge that here you literally buy
your wife?”—to which he retorted, “Of course we do; while in Europe
it is the wife who buys her husband; we are up to that;” and he
chuckled, and seemed to think he had paid me off with interest.</p>

<p>After passing the pools, where I had stayed so long, we came in
sight of the line of the fortifications, which<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_143">[143]</span> are now almost buried in sand, and of
one of the city gates, still an imposing mass. The plain where
Tolmeta stood did not become visible until we had crossed the low
ridge formed by the fallen walls. Great was the disappointment I
experienced on my first view of the city, and greater became my
disappointment the more I saw of it. Three columns standing over
large covered cisterns, and two smaller ones not far distant, the
ruined apse of a Christian church (probably of the fourth century),
catch the eye; but the general impression of the entire surface is
that of a huge piece of new macadamisation, so thickly is the
ground strewed with small fragments. The celebrated barracks have
been lately despoiled, by truly Vandalic hands, of the curious
inscription which rendered the building so interesting, and to
obtain which the greater part of the front facing the sea has been
overthrown. The destruction of it seems to have been as wanton as
the labour of it must have been great, the architecture being of
the most solid description. I was told that in attempting their
removal one of the slabs was so broken that the author of this
devastation left it lying on the ground; and that after an interval
of two or three years, when he had learnt in Paris that an
inscription, of which a third part is wanting, is worthless, he
sent for the remaining fragments, which were already
illegible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> If those
employed were incapable of taking an accurate copy of the
inscription, one would suppose that they might at least have made a
cast of it, and at less expense, and thus have left the only
monument worth visiting in Ptolemais still retaining its external
form, and the disposition of its interior still traceable, and
unchoked by newly-made ruins. The three Ionic columns, which have
been described as dating from the earliest times and of remarkable
purity, seemed to me of a late epoch, when not a tradition of true
beauty remained; they are clumsy, and badly chiselled, nor did I
see in the whole space any fragments of sculpture or architecture
in a good style of art. There are ten vaulted buildings, and a very
large rectangle rising only a few feet above the soil, whose
purpose cannot even be guessed at; scanty remains of a theatre, the
outlines of an amphitheatre, formed in a quarry, having no feature
of interest, complete the catalogue of the ruins within the town.
The fortifications towards the sea, consisting of a series of
forts, are well preserved, though nearly buried in sand; but the
most conspicuous object is the gateway I have already mentioned,
whose two flank towers are still nearly perfect. On the stones of
which these are built are many inscriptions, whose irregularity
would lead one to the idea that they are of very recent date, or
even to fancy them the work of industrious idlers,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> bent upon thus immortalising
their names. Fox’s and many other names, carved with a knife on the
old walls at Eton, are far better specimens of caligraphy. More
interesting than these are the quarry-marks, many of them in
Barbary characters, which are found here, as well as on one of the
forts on the sea-wall.</p>

<p>On the second day of my stay here the clouds gathered thick
towards sunset, whereupon soon followed a storm of lightning and
rain, such as I have seldom witnessed. The autumnal rains had
commenced, and it was evident that my proper course was a speedy
return to Benghazi, as when it does rain here it continues, almost
without intermission, for many days, and with a frantic violence
which no tents can withstand. I had been too much disappointed with
the remains of Tolmeta to regret having to shorten my stay here;
and when the rain ceased the next morning, or only continued in
fitful showers, I had the wet tents and baggage placed on the
camels, and took my departure for Tancra, the ancient Tenchira. It
was, however, so late before a start could be made, that at sunset
we were still at no great distance from the ruins, and finding a
good place for encamping near some wells, and fields sown with
<i>izra</i>, I stopped there. The route is along the sea-shore,
through a wide plain covered with briars and baturne<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span> bushes, showing only in very
few places slight marks of cultivation. A soft warm wind, like that
of a spring morning, made the ride through the clean-washed
underwood delightful, and I fancied I could already see signs of
fresh vegetation in the briars. It took, in all, nine hours and a
half to reach Tancra from Dolmeita. Near the old town are many
patches of cultivated ground, producing vegetables and fruit, the
property of Arab families, who inhabit many of the excavated tombs
in the quarries on either side of the town.</p>

<p>The first view of Tancra rather disappointed me. So much has
been written about the perfect state of the walls, that I arrived
there with the expectation of finding them more perfect than the
walls of either Rome or Constantinople; and what, indeed, have
these cities, amidst all their remains of bygone days, to offer of
more interest than their venerable walls, which, after withstanding
unnumbered hostile attacks, still retain so much of their
historical significance? The circuit of the walls of Tenchira is on
three sides entire; the disposition of the towers is well marked,
and the places of the gates may be conjectured: in many parts the
wall is not more than two or three feet high, in some it is reduced
to a mere heap of stones, and in none does it exceed fourteen or
fifteen feet. At the eastern extremity, a quarry has been taken
advantage of, to add<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_147">[147]</span> strength to the wall by being made to serve
as a ditch; on the ground above there are remains of a strong
fortalice. Within these is another quarry, which serves to isolate
the fortress—a narrow ledge of rock, along which the wall ran,
alone affording access to it; this, with a third parallel to the
sea, seems to have completed this curious defensive structure, for
such I suppose it may be considered. The walls are, doubtless,
interesting to the military antiquarian, exhibiting, as they do
very perfectly, the system of fortification used at the time of
their reconstruction or repair by order of Justinian; but they
disappoint the traveller in search of the artistic or the
picturesque, who had hoped to find in Greek or Roman style what
Alatri presents in the Cyclopean. The ill-carved inscriptions with
which they are covered—mere records of names which have evidently
belonged to other buildings, and many of them now turned upside
down—possess no kind of interest; and I am inclined to think that
the walls of Apollonia, if cleared of their rubbish, would be found
more perfect, as well as more picturesque. But if disappointed with
the exterior of the town, I was equally surprised by finding the
contents of the interior more interesting than anything I had met
with in the Cyrenaica; and then I had to regret that I had allowed
myself to be so long enchained by the delightful climate of the
hills, as to render a long stay<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_148">[148]</span> in Tancra impossible on account of the
rains, which this year set in nearly a month earlier than usual.
The town, indeed, contains no monuments of any great elevation,
which accounts for the little attention which seems to have been
bestowed on Tancra by previous travellers; at the season when they
visited it everything must have been hidden by the long grass; but
when the ground is bare of vegetation, as at my visit, many lines
of streets become as distinctly traceable as those of Pompeii, and
even the ground plans of the houses which bordered them. Among the
larger buildings, are to be remarked the ruins of a church in the
west of the city, and those of a large quadrangle, with a
well-preserved reservoir within its precincts, which, from its
similarity to the hapless barracks at Dolmeita, must have had a
similar purpose. Further eastward, is a striking edifice bearing
inscriptions, which may have been a temple or a basilica, but its
interior is so completely filled with rubbish, that its plan cannot
be distinguished. No trace of a theatre, amphitheatre, or stadium
is visible; so that the inhabitants of Tenchira must, in all
probability, have had the misfortune to be destitute of any place
of public amusement. I have remarked with surprise in other parts
of the Pentapolis, as well as here, the absence of any well-defined
ruins of public baths; though I cannot suppose that any town, even
of small size, was in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_149">[149]</span> Roman times destitute of so necessary and
favourite a luxury. The only hypothesis which presents itself to me
as explanatory of this, is the fact, that these towns, as we see
them at the present day, belong to the later empire, during whose
existence the opposition shown by the bishops and clergy to the
delicacy of the bath (<i>balneorum deliciæ</i>) may, in some
places, have succeeded in suppressing its use. No place in this
country promises a more abundant harvest to the excavator than
this: medals must be buried in great quantities, and perhaps other
articles of value, among its ruins; and the tombs sunk in the rocks
all around are, with those of Benghazi, the only ones in the
country that seem to have escaped desecration. All those which were
excavated in the quarries have been long since rifled; and even
those have not escaped which are now sanded up, as was recently
proved, to his great disappointment, by an Arab antiquarian, who,
no doubt, having read, adopted Beechey’s suggestion, and employed
money, men, and much time, in clearing one of those nearest to the
town, on the west side. Beechey, judging from their situation, had
conjectured that these tombs were the most ancient; and that, as
they had probably been early sanded up, they would offer a good
chance of rewarding researches. The event proved that his opinion
was incorrect, as the tomb, a large square cavern, was empty of
everything<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span> but
sand; above the door of it is a cross in a circle, with the letters
I C . X C. There are tombs cut like troughs on the summits of the
rocks on which the quarries are sunk, which yield great numbers of
vases, but all that were found, whilst I was there, were of very
coarse manufacture. I saw in the hands of an Arab a small fragment
of a large and very finely-painted urn of the latest style, and
although such are not, of course, common, I believe they are
occasionally found. I had intended to spend some days here, and to
open a large number of tombs, whose position I had conjectured from
the hollow sound the ground above gave out when struck; but the
rains had now set in, descending every night in torrents, and
frequently lasting all day; so that no working was possible, and in
the small tents a dry spot could not be preserved. The discomfort
produced by the rain, however, was even exceeded by the destruction
it brought to books and instruments; I therefore left Tancra, and
firmly resolved that my first purchase in Benghazi should be one of
the hair tents of the Arabs, which, though not quite impervious to
rain, are yet the best protection one can have against it. As used
in this country, they are generally about eighteen feet long, by
fifteen broad, the roof formed of long stripes of coarse hair-cloth
woven by the women. The roof is sometimes made in white for winter
use; but more generally it is of a brown,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_151">[151]</span> earthy colour, with stripes of black and
white. No cutting out or other fashioning is necessary, for the
cloth, being sufficiently elastic, accommodates itself to the slope
of the roof. Two poles, three feet apart, support the tent, giving
in the centre a height of about seven feet, while the corners and
edges are stretched by cords, and supported by slender spars, at
about half this height from the ground. Three sides are closed by
stripes of the same stuff, rudely attached to the roof by wooden
pins, the fourth—that turned to leeward—being left open. In summer,
the sides are removed, and branches are used to replace them,
while, in general, an older roof is substituted for the better one
used in winter. With a little management, they might be made
comfortable enough, and, with the exception of the great weight of
the hair-cloth of which they are formed, they would be very
convenient for travelling, as they are easily set up, are exposed
to no accidents which could not be remedied on the spot, and are
less liable than cotton tents to rot when packed up wet. Against
this evil I have found M‘Gregor’s anti-dry-rot preparation of no
use. I have one tent of prepared, and one of unprepared canvas, and
have yet found no difference in the condition of their
materials.</p>

<p>On the third day after my arrival in Tancra, I reluctantly
pursued my journey to Benghazi. In an<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_152">[152]</span> hour and a quarter we reached Bou Jera’a,
which has many gardens and wells. An hour and a half further on
lies Birsis, with its few insignificant ruins and its many wells;
it afforded one of the pleasantest autumnal scenes I had beheld for
a long time: whole villages of tents in quick succession, fields
everywhere separated by well-made inclosures, and the whole
landscape animated by a busy industry, in which all ages and sexes
seemed equally to join. This is the only part of the Pentapolis
which has the appearance of being inhabited. The damp, warm air of
the morning communicated a sensation of enjoyment to the frame; and
the unwonted life of the scene recalled more civilised lands to my
mind.</p>

<p>The appearance of the country soon, however, changed; and we
entered upon a tract most dreary and desolate. The path winds
further inland, being separated from the sea by an extensive marsh,
along the edge of which it runs at the foot of low rocks; the dark,
stunted vegetation interspersed among the stony wastes gave an air
of indescribable melancholy to the landscape. A journey of six
hours and a half through this dull flat brought us to Sidi Suaiken,
a marābut on an eminence; beyond this the country becomes more
wooded, and green meadows appear, in one of which I encamped. There
is a place of the name of Handouleh, consisting of a few gardens
and rich<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span> pastures,
which lies about an hour and a half from the marābut; further on to
the right is the large salt lake of Ez-zajana, a favourite resort
of the Benghazini in their excursions. Near here are extensive
ruins, showing only the ground plan of many buildings, which, from
the name, are supposed to mark the site of Adrianopolis. Soon after
this the road enters the dried sandy bed of the salt lake, which,
filled by the winter gales from the sea, gradually evaporates in
the course of the summer. At length, we again reached Benghazi,
after an absence of rather more than three months.</p>

<p class="csum">What a Consul should be. — Turkish Oppression. —
Official Corruption. — Universal Venality. — The Moslem hates the

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">On</span> arriving in Benghazi I
found a house prepared for me, by the kindness of one of my
friends, who gave up to me the only waterproof rooms which, I
believe, exist in the town. The sensation of sleeping within walls,
after three months spent under canvas, was not the less agreeable
from the circumstance that the rain poured down in torrents, and
only ceased for short intervals during my ten days’ stay. The
second day after my arrival there fell a deluge of rain, the effect
of which was to wash down some thirty houses, while there was not
perhaps one in the place which had not suffered more or less. This
is owing to the houses being built with mud instead of lime, which
might be had at a very small cost. In the Frank quarter some new
houses were in process of building, and not being roofed in, were
more liable to suffer than finished<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_155">[155]</span> buildings. As I passed them the next day
their interior literally presented mere heaps of ruins. Year after
year the same devastation is produced by the same cause; the flat
roofs, formed, as they are, of mats laid over beams, with a heavy
superstructure of sea-weeds and mud, are never waterproof; yet such
is the apathy, even of the European residents, that they make no
attempt to secure dry quarters for the winter. One would think from
their conduct that it had never rained here before, and that the
visitation, instead of being as regular as the almanack, had taken
all the world by surprise. In one house I found workmen repairing
fallen walls; in another, I heard that the whole family had to
sleep on the bales in the warehouse, which admitted the water in
fewer places than the other rooms. The streets were in many places
impassable from the ruins; and many houses were literally melted
away, the beams and stones remaining imbedded in huge puddles of
mud. It sometimes occurs, when the rains are more than usually
heavy, that the houses are in so menacing a state that the whole
town takes refuge in tents, where, though the ground be damp, there
are certainly no walls which threaten to overwhelm them.</p>

<p>I had the pleasure of finding the newly-appointed English
Vice-Consul, Mr. Werry, a gentleman well<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_156">[156]</span> known to our officers who served in the
Syrian expedition. I was glad to offer him personally my thanks for
the ready politeness with which he had taken measures to insure my
safety while in the interior. Though he had only been two months in
Benghazi, he had already secured the good-will and confidence of
the British subjects for whose interest he is placed there, as well
as the respect of the Turkish authorities. During the ten days I
stayed in Benghazi he gave me frequent opportunities of increasing
my debt of gratitude to him. I regretted to leave behind me, in so
dreary an exile, one whose official experience, whose activity, and
familiar knowledge of all the Oriental languages, would enable him
to render essential services to his Government in places of more
importance. I do not by this mean to insinuate that the presence of
a British Consul in Benghazi is of little utility, although the
number of Europeans (they are nearly all British subjects) be very
small. Unconnected with trade, our Vice-Consul holds an independent
position, which those of other nations, fettered by their personal
interests, cannot attain, and he is thus frequently able, in cases
of gross injustice affecting the natives, to exercise a salutary
influence with the governor. His house is the ready refuge of the
ill-used slave and the oppressed Arab, and his exertions in their
behalf,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span> rarely
unavailing for them, give a prestige to the name of Englishman, of
which I more than once experienced the value.</p>

<p>This portion of the pachalic of Tripoli, in which I passed
nearly six months, is, like so many countries belonging to the
Turkish Empire, most bountifully endowed by nature with every
source of wealth. Under former rulers it was flourishing and
populous, but it has now become a waste; its scanty inhabitants are
sunk in hopeless barbarism, and even their poverty is no defence
against the grasping avarice of their governor—“Inter continuas
rapinas, perpetuò inops.” I do not accuse the present Sultan or
ministers in Constantinople, individually, of the tyranny and
ignorance which render his rule a curse wherever it is
acknowledged; but—after seeing the fields of Roumelia lying waste
to the very gates of his residence, the cities of Asia Minor
depopulated, its mineral wealth a sealed treasure, even the Arab
glories of Syria faded, the palaces of Damascus crumbling, and its
marts deserted—the traveller cannot but long to see a government
changed whose oppression is less mischievous than its neglects, and
which tacitly permits wrongs greater than those which it
sanctions.<a id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class=
"fnanchor">[4]</a> Well has it been said, that where the hoof of a
Turkish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span> horse has
touched the ground, there the grass grows not.</p>

<p>During the last twenty-five years, since the fall of the
Janissaries (which seemed to strengthen the central government
while it weakened the empire), there has been much law-making, and
many abuses have been abolished, as far as edicts can abolish
deeply-rooted customs; but the old spirit still breathes in the new
régime, and injustice and oppression are as frequent under the
present Sultan as under his predecessors. It is, indeed, no longer
a matter of indifference to the Grand Vizier, “whether the dog
devours the swine or the swine the dog.” A wholesome fear of
European opinion has succeeded to undisguised contempt; but the
Turk of the people is still in his own eyes the first of human
beings; his Sultan is still the suzerain before whom all kings bow,
and at whose orders the French and English krals send their fleets
and troops to chastise the rebellious Egyptian or Muscovite; and in
the remoter provinces, which are beyond the immediate eye of the
Elehi Beys, as they call the foreign ambassadors, the old system of
peculation and robbery exists in full force.</p>

<p>Much has been written in praise of the new organisation of the
Turkish Government, and the Tanzimat, as the regulations for the
service are called; but the good which this contains is for the
most part evaded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span> or
neglected. The most real result of the reform has been to introduce
a number of new functionaries, or, in other words, to increase the
points of contact between the governors and the governed, whereby
more frequent opportunities of peculation are given to the former.
The sanitary regulations, so ridiculous in the way they are
enforced and the way they are neglected, are one instance of this;
another is the prohibition of presents from inferiors to superiors,
which all employés take an oath to observe; yet it would not be
easy to find ten per cent. of the higher officers who are
insensible to, or unwilling to accept such an argument. In trifling
things they are, of course, careful to wear the mask of austere
virtue, as Izzet Pacha, the Governor of Tripoli, lately recalled on
the complaints of the French Government, showed, when he was here
in summer. A merchant of the place sent him a basket of grapes,
when they were still scarce, and he returned them, saying, that,
according to his oath, he must either pay for or refuse them. Yet
this is the man who, after keeping an Arab sheikh in prison for
many months, released him on receiving 150,000 piastres, about
£1500; and whose sons, youths of eighteen and twenty years,
established in their father’s pachalic a trade in all the produce
of the country, which amounted to a virtual monopoly. The European
merchants sent a remonstrance on this subject to Constantinople,
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span> they received
an answer, in the advancement of the elder of these enterprising
young tradesmen to the dignity of Mirabi, or pacha of one tail.</p>

<p>After the last harvest the cultivators of the soil complained
that the tithe in kind due to Government was taken in such a way as
to amount to nearly one-half of the entire produce. This had been
contrived by Izzet Pacha’s son and some of the local authorities;
the tenth only being carried to the public account, and the
remainder divided among themselves. Many representations to this
effect were made to the French consular agent, who, after obtaining
satisfactory evidence of their truth, reported the case to his
superior in Tripoli. Not long afterwards, on some dispute with the
Pacha, the Consul brought this up as a proof of the malversation of
the subordinates, on which the other pretended great indignation,
and insisted that he and the Consul should send to Benghazi for
information. The books were, of course, in good order; the
witnesses, on whose testimony the Consul had relied, were by
threats reduced to silence; the charge could not be substantiated
(the Bey who was judge being himself the chief delinquent); and the
upshot of the inquiry was, that the Vice-Consul had to make
apologies for the slander, while he and every Frank in the place
knew the truth of the accusation, and could point out the magazines
where the grain thus extorted was<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_161">[161]</span> deposited. Many weeks had not passed after
this when ships belonging to the Pacha’s son arrived in the port,
and openly loaded with this very corn on his account.</p>

<p>When a pacha acts thus, we cannot wonder if his subordinates
imitate so good an example; and the director of the customs may be
praised for the honesty which consigns about three-fourths of their
produce to the treasury. An Arab said to me one day, on this
subject, “The Pacha eats, the Bey eats, and the Gumruckdjy
(director of customs) eats,” each buying his superior’s silence
with a share of his own peculations; the friends who protect his
interests at Constantinople coming in for their share of the
pacha’s profits. A Turk is, in fact, capable of learning many
things; he may be <i>civilisé</i>—a Frank word, now adopted in
Turkish; he may cease to be what <i>La Jeune Turquie</i> calls a
fanatic; he will indulge in deep potations, or abstain from fasting
in Ramadhan; but he will never learn not to eat (Italicè
<i>magnare</i>) when he can. His appetite and digestion, in this
sense, are truly ostrich-like. On inquiring into the truth of the
Bey’s statement that there are 1200 houses in Benghazi, I learned
that there are, in fact, 1400, the two hundred which are suppressed
in the official account being “eaten” by the Bey and the
Sheikh-el-belid.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>An amusing
instance of the ruses to which a scrupulous man, who has the fear
of his oath before his eyes, will resort, was related to me by one
who was in the town at the time it occurred. An Armenian addressed
himself to a Pacha in Anadoly, for the decision of a lawsuit in his
favour; and, after stating his case, produced a bag well filled
with the usual arguments, which he offered to his Excellency. On
this the great man, who had listened to his statement with the
blandest smiles, drew himself up, frowning in anger, and only
answered, “Infidel, be off!” The poor Armenian, astonished at the
reception of his well-meant offering, begged and prayed, and seemed
to weigh the bag in his hands, that the Pacha might see how heavy
it was—all Spanish dollars; but the only answer he obtained was a
fresh order to be off, with the surly addition, “He is an infidel
who gives, and an infidel who takes”—disobedience to the Sultan’s
laws being rebellion, and rebellion, according to Turkish doctrine,
infidelity. Disappointed and crest-fallen, the poor Armenian
withdrew from the presence, and was not a little surprised to find
himself the object of the congratulations of the attendants and
cavasses in the anteroom. “It is useless,” he said, “to ask me for
backshish; for the Pacha has rejected my suit, and that, too, with
hard words.” “What answer is this?” said they; “did you not hear
his words—‘the infidel<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_163">[163]</span> gives and the infidel takes?’ Go to the
steward; is not he also an Armenian?”</p>

<p>One of the greatest blots on the Turkish constitution has not
been touched by the Tanzimat: it is that provision of the Moslem
law which excludes the reception of evidence given by persons of
other religions against a Moslem. Twenty witnesses may depose to
the murder of a Christian or Jew by a Turk; but, as was too clearly
shown in the case of Sir Lawrence Jones, if there be not among them
at least two Moslemin, their testimony is unavailing; while to
obtain Moslem witnesses to prove an outrage on a Christian is
impossible.<a id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class=
"fnanchor">[5]</a> An Arab was wantonly beating a Maltese boy, a
few days ago, in the bazaar, when a respectable Moslem came to his
assistance; a third then came up, and apostrophised the boy’s
defender, saying, “Are you a Moslem? and do you take the part of a
Christian against a believer?” He spoke what all the spectators
felt. Until this odious distinction be abolished, there can be no
security either for the life or property of Christian rayahs or
foreigners, excepting in the energy and privileges of the consuls;
and the representatives of the great powers seem at present
disposed to yield the greater part of their own rights and
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span> immunities of
their fellow-subjects. These were wisely considered essential to
the welfare or consideration of foreigners among a people who,
though little less than barbarians, look with the most profound
contempt upon a Frank; and those who renounce their enjoyment are,
I fear, too precipitate in their favourable judgment of the real
state of the Turkish Empire.</p>

<p>I cannot close my notes of the Cyrenaica without adding that I
spent there (occasional annoyances excepted) some most pleasant
months; I came to the country an invalid, and was exceedingly
unwell when I started for Grennah; but its pure air and lovely
scenery restored me to perfect health. For those who seek summer
quarters in the Mediterranean, I again repeat to them my former
advice, to choose the pleasant solitudes of Cyrene in preference to
the Syrian hills, where so much sickness and mortality prevail. I
have been many times in the Lebanon, and the rich beauty of
Damascus has greater charms for me than that of any city I have
seen; but, still, I have never been there without witnessing or
feeling the effects of the pestilential air, which, every autumn,
produces fatal fevers and dysenteries. Even in quitting its shores
the evil spirit seems to pursue its victims; and I have seen more
than one friend seized with the deadly Syrian fever weeks after he
had reached a healthier climate.</p>

<p class="csum">Benghazi to Augila. — Corn Stores. — Cachettes. —
Ruins near El-Farsy. — Remarkable Fortress. — Horrors of the Slave
Trade. — England should forbid it. — Herds of Gazelles. — Bruce. —
Rĕsam. — Oasis of Augila.</p>

<p class="nind"><em>November 4th.</em>—After many <i>pour
parlers</i> with a caravan of Majabra (inhabitants of Jalo), who
had come to Benghazi to sell their dates, and after making one or
two false starts, I at length got under weigh for Augila. I was
desirous of taking with me some hawks, as the country I was to pass
through for the first days of the journey was represented to be
full of game; and the trained hawks of this place are said to be
the best in Africa; but I was unable to purchase any. Some of my
friends assured me that I should find no difficulty in obtaining
the birds from the Arabs; but I eventually found that my informants
were mistaken. Both in Benghazi and in its neighbourhood, I often
met horsemen with a hawk, either perched on the right hand or
seated on the crupper of the horse; but I never found any one
willing to part with this favourite companion. Yet there are
seasons of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span> year
when they are to be had at a small price; in spring, many young
hawks are brought to the market, and the proprietors of trained
birds will then willingly dispose of theirs, at a price for which
they can buy a dozen young ones, whose education they find both
amusing and profitable.</p>

<p>Stopping to rearrange the luggage half a dozen times while the
town was still in sight, our progress the first day was very slow,
and we pitched the tents for the night at a distance of about eight
miles from Benghazi, having traversed a country unmarked by any
feature but the shapeless ruins of what may once have been an
extensive villa, or a very small village. The next day, we reached,
in three hours, extensive ruins, called by the Arabs Idirsa, which
cover much ground, but nowhere offer extensive <i>débris</i>, nor
even a plan of any large building. The sea, though still in sight,
lay considerably to the right. Avoiding the promontory of Bozium,
and the site of the old Jewish colony (which presents nothing
remarkable), I followed the road which runs through the middle of
the wide plain lying between the hills which I crossed in going to
Cyrene, and the sea, which here trends gradually to the west. Two
hours further on, we came to a place, Ourm Sofah, marked by very
deep wells hewn in the rock, beside which was a pool formed by the
recent rains. At this moment, the country is<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_167">[167]</span> dotted far and near with such sheets of
water, formed wherever a clay bottom, or a depression in the rocks,
presents a surface favourable for the collection of the rain. Herds
of cattle render these pools muddy and uninviting to the eye; but
when they have just been formed, there is probably no risk in
drinking their water. For greater precaution, however, as well as
to accustom my servants to the trouble, I had the water boiled
before we drank it; this process, of course, gave it an unpalatable
flatness, but it is thought necessary, in order to avoid the risk
of fevers, so often caused by drinking stagnant water. During this
day’s journey and the two succeeding ones, we saw in every
direction groups of Arab tents, inhabited by people from Benghazi,
who had come to sow the extensive plain we were passing through.
The soil is a rich loam, yielding, without any sort of tilling,
abundant harvests of wheat and barley. It seems probable that, if a
moderate amount of labour were expended in the husbandry of this
country, its ample crops would vie with those of Egypt or Sicily.
As it is, nature is left to herself; when the winter is rainy, the
crops are very large, but if the rains are scanty, the harvest
fails. In autumn, after the first rains, the seed is scattered
broadcast on the ground, and over this a light plough of wood, shod
with iron, is drawn, turning up, or rather scratching, the ground,
to a depth of about two inches. By this<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_168">[168]</span> process the seed is covered. The husbandman
returns to Benghazi, and no other care is bestowed upon the crop
until the sower returns in spring to reap it. The land is open to
the first comer, the Government receiving a tenth of the produce as
rent; but this rent is very arbitrarily fixed, and thereby ample
room is given to the ingenuity of the Turkish <i>employés</i>. The
result is that the taxation is often most exorbitant, as I have
mentioned in a former page. This year the early rains gave an
impulse to speculation. About one-third of the Benghazini were now
squatting on the plain; every animal—horse, ass, ox, cow, or
camel—that could be made to drag the light ploughshare having been
laid under contribution. The prices of these animals had,
consequently, increased greatly in the market. If the winter proved
as rainy as it threatened, sundry little fortunes would no doubt be
made. Many of the Europeans and wealthier Arabs, who do not
themselves go to the country, employ a man to sow seed for them,
they providing the seed and cattle; the man receives half the
profit, besides 160 piastres—about thirty shillings—for sowing and
reaping.</p>

<p>Eight hours from Ourm Sofah are the ruins of a large castle of
the same character and epoch as those of Benigdun, called
Tell-i-mout. The walls are, in the lower part, formed by four
courses of large masonry;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_169">[169]</span> and above, to an equal, or rather greater
height (probably a later construction), they are built of small
stones. There remain two sides of an oblong rectangle, with a
square tower at the north-east corner, whose entrance is by a
well-turned arch from the interior. The large stones of the lower
courses are literally covered with Tawarick characters—most
probably merely indicating the passage by them of the Arab tribes,
which use one or other of these signs as their distinctive marks;
but the number, size, and regularity of these characters in this
place are truly astonishing. During the remainder of this day’s
journey the character of the country remained unchanged, and
nothing marked our course except a solitary marābut, Sidi Keilani,
on the right, three hours and a half from Tell-i-mout; from hence
proceeding as far again, we reached the first Bedawin tents we had
seen since we left Benghazi, pitched in a place called Keif-i-djil.
Here there are large stores of grain, formed on the same principle
as the <i>cachettes</i> or <i>silos</i> of the Algerian tribes,
which resemble the grain stores at Leghorn. A conical hole, dug in
the ground, is lined with straw, and after being filled with grain,
is thatched over with straw and mud. The people assured me that
neither ants nor vermin ever attack these stores, and at Leghorn I
have heard it asserted that in the similar receptacles there, built
of stone and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
plastered, the grain can be preserved good for fifty years. Two
hours further on are ponds and a well, in a place called Sa’aity.
Here the ground is covered with large fragments of stone, and
seemed a favourite resort of scorpions, which the Arabs, who were
with me, amused themselves in hunting. They brought me one of a
greenish yellow colour, fully five inches long. The gerboas also
abound in this place; they are about the size of a rat, and one
sees them towards evening in great numbers, jumping along like the
kangaroo, their long, elegant tail, tipped with white, trailing on
the ground; the plain is riddled with their holes, which makes
quick riding very unsafe.</p>

<p>At Sa’aity I remained half a day, while the camel-drivers bought
food for their beasts from some grain stores on a slight hill above
the well. These Majabra were in many respects the worst people I
had yet had to deal with; the only good quality I discovered in
them was the rapidity with which they loaded in the morning. The
time gained in this way, however, was lost in another; their object
in such quick loading being merely to get off, and to leave as much
of their load as they could behind them. The consequence of this
was, that as much as two camels could conveniently carry, fell to
the share of the last-loaded camels, over and above their fair
allowance. On such occasions I had to make the whole caravan
return, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span> cost
quick riding and loud words; and then at length each received his
fair proportion of the articles that had been left. Day after day
the same scene was renewed, until I at last resorted to the
expedient of having my carpet spread for breakfast on the road they
were to take—a scheme which, united with constant watchfulness, I
found tolerably successful. They have another accomplishment,
hardly less agreeable to the traveller who is at their mercy. They
must have learned, that if eloquence be silver, silence is gold;
and therefore they show themselves most unwilling to afford the
smallest particle of information, silencing questions with a
prolonged nasal grunt, which seems to play the same part in their
conversation as the “So-o-o!” of the Germans. On the journey they
sing their unmelodious chaunts nearly all day long, one relieving
the other; their song being at rare intervals interrupted by an
occasional admonition to a camel to make a little more way. They
never swear at their beasts, however, as European, and especially
Italian, postilions are in the habit of doing; the ear is not,
therefore, shocked with the obscene blasphemies which are so
offensive on a journey in the Roman or Neapolitan States. Here the
driver apostrophises his camel with one invariable expression of
abuse, which seems quite as efficacious as a volley of oaths—“Oh,
you Jew!” and the camel mends its pace. It is true that<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span> this is usually accompanied
with an admonition from a full-grown stick, which may perhaps have
some effect in quickening its step; but I am persuaded,
nevertheless, that the insult to its feelings has more to do in
rousing it to exertion, than the application of the bâton to its
hide. The food of the Majabra is <i>basina</i>, like that of the
Barca Arabs, a mess prepared with flour, water, and salt, kneaded
into a tough paste, then boiled, and eaten with a little oil or
butter; it is a tough, and must be a most indigestible composition.
They eat enormous quantities of it, re-kneading it with the fingers
of the right hand into large balls, and dipping in oil, so as to
enable them to bolt it; to see them devour it is one among the most
wonderful things in this country.</p>

<p>There are wells, for which I could obtain no name, ten hours
from Sa’aity. After this, the country becomes somewhat less level
than it has hitherto been, swelling in slight hills, the soil more
stony and sandy, less capable of producing grain, and covered with
low, thorny, and fleshy-leaved shrubs. Five and a half hours
further on, are wells, called El Farsy. These, like the preceding
ones, are pierced in the rock, and to obtain the water from them,
it is necessary for some one to be lowered into the well, as the
water does not lie immediately under the upper orifice. There is a
large chamber hollowed in the rock, in one corner of<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span> which the well is sunk; I did
not descend into it, and it was not till I was far past it, that
one of the men told me there were inscriptions on its sides. This
is as likely to be false as true, as I have twenty times gone, on
the strength of Arab information, to look for inscriptions in
places where nothing of the sort was to be seen; but this would
have been no reason for neglecting to examine this well-chamber,
had I known of it in time. It was now too late in the evening to
return that day, and the next I was not inclined for an expedition
whose result was so uncertain, while I had before me the more
promising ruins of El-Ajdabiah.</p>

<p>These old Saracenic ruins are four hours and a half from El
Farsy; they present groups of buildings situated on two low hills,
about a quarter of a mile apart. The centre of the intervening
space is a flat bare rock, in which several wells are pierced. The
first group which the traveller, coming from Benghazi, meets,
contains the remains of a castle of excellent architecture, which
cannot be later than the third century of the Hejirah. It is a
rectangular structure, terminating in three vaulted chambers, the
extremity of the centre one of which has an octagonal niche, on
which the plaster still remains. This end is flanked by round,
dome-covered towers, whose sides are perforated with loopholes for
arrows; but neither within nor without,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_174">[174]</span> neither above nor below, could I discover
ornament or inscription. Failing here, I now turned to the opposite
group of ruins, the <i>débris</i> of a very large mosque, in which
I had no doubt that I should find something to reward me for having
chosen this route rather than the shorter one, which, from Sa’aity,
takes more to the eastward. The mosque is in even a more ruinous
condition than the castle, but is of equally good construction; in
one corner are still standing about fifteen feet of the light-sided
minaret; towards the other, three light and lofty arches, and
beyond them the Kibleh niche, or minbar. Round its arch may be
traced remains of a zigzag ornament, and on the capital of one of
the two pillars which support it, I persuaded myself that I could
trace the first three letters of the profession of faith. Believing
implicitly the accounts I had somewhere read of the ornamental
inscriptions of Ajdabiah, I had bargained with my camel-men to stay
here two or three days if I required it, in order to examine them;
but no exertion of eyesight or imagination could enable me to
discover more than these three letters, if they were really such;
for, after all, they might have been mere accidental scratches in
the stone. Whatever may have been the case when the buildings were
less ruinous, I can safely affirm that there is in no part of them
now a trace of an inscription in any character, excepting those
Arab marks to which I have<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_175">[175]</span> already several times alluded. I was
greatly disappointed; and as soon as the water-skins were filled
(an operation which was protracted during four hours), I saw the
caravan depart. I took myself a S.S.W. direction, though with
little hope of any satisfactory result; and rode to Henayah, a
distance of about seven miles.</p>

<p>Henayah is a strong fortress of very early architecture, and by
far the most curious construction I had met with in these
countries. The squared mass of rock, on which the keep is built, is
not higher than the surrounding ground; but it is isolated by a dry
moat, fourteen feet wide, and nine deep, cut in the living rock. On
the square mass, eighty feet on every side, left in the centre,
rose the walls of the keep, of which only a few feet in height now
remain. It is approached by means of a wall, hardly fifteen inches
broad, which is built across the moat on one side. This wall was,
perhaps, once the support of a moveable bridge. The interior of the
rock’s base is entirely excavated, forming a centre chamber, now
open to the sky, and entered by a flight of steps; round this
chamber are cut a number of vaults, communicating with it, and
having small openings, to admit light and air, pierced in the
sides. This is, however, only the smallest part of the old
stronghold, its size being greatly increased by extensive caves, to
the number of twenty-eight, cut in the rock, beyond the moat,
into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span> which they all
open. In no part of these laborious excavations could I discover
any inscription, or any evidence of their origin; but, judging from
the beautiful execution of the whole—from the form of the lamp
niches which are cut in several of the vaults, as well as from the
general style, resembling what is found in some of the Greek
isles—I have no hesitation in ascribing it to a date coeval with
the best monuments in Cyrene.</p>

<p>The water of its wells, being the last sweet water to be met
with before reaching Augila, pointed it out as a natural
resting-place for the caravans which brought gold, gems, slaves,
and ivory, from the interior to Cyrene. I cannot, therefore, doubt,
that it must have served as a fortress, and, not improbably, also
as a magazine for the caravans trading with the interior and with
Carthage. El Ajdabiah replaced it in the Saracenic epoch; and so
little have things changed in the long lapse of years, that the
wells of the latter place, though its castles and mosques have
fallen, are still the favourite halt of the caravans passing
between Benghazi and Augila.</p>

<p>The commerce is now insignificant; Augila and Jalo have only
dates to send in exchange for corn and the few manufactured
articles which the rude life of these people requires. At uncertain
and long intervals, however, when the great caravan from Waday
arrives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span> life is
given to the commerce of Benghazi. Then the old picture of Cyrenean
commerce is for a short time renewed. The desert, for weeks, is
alive with long files of camels, which arrive, laden with ivory and
gum; and with them, alas! as in old times, hundreds of unhappy
creatures—the spoil of war—condemned to slavery, who come halting
in, at the end of this first hundred days’ stage of their misery.
How many, happier than their fellows, have dropped exhausted on the
dreary road! Twenty-one degrees they traverse on foot, exposed to
the rays of a tropical sun, when, for twelve days at a time, no
water is found; without clothing, and having a handful of meal for
their daily food. Fatigue and thirst in vain lessen the numbers of
the melancholy caravan; the number of “heads” brought to the market
diminish, but the profit of the traffic is still enormous, being
more lucrative than that of ivory, which, from Waday, yields at
least 500 per cent. I have heard natives describe the appearance of
one of these caravans on its arrival, and the sufferings of the
slaves, with a simplicity of language, and a reckless
thoughtlessness, most heart-rending. And to think that a single
word from England could arrest these horrors! In treaties and
conventions we have spurned all the old established laws of
international right, in our desire to put down<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_178">[178]</span> the slave trade in the colonies of
independent sovereigns; but it would seem as though we dared not
put a veto upon a branch of it ten times more cruel than was the
slave trade on the Atlantic before we declared it piracy. It may be
answered, that we may indeed force Turkey to abolish the slave
trade in words, but that we cannot ensure the performance of her
promises; that we can send no men-of-war into the deserts to
enforce our humane decrees; that slavery is bound up with Islam;
and that society in the East is, in fact, founded upon the godless
institution. Many will also say (and this I do not deny), that when
at length the slaves are brought into the Turkish dominions, they
become comparatively happy, are well clothed, well fed, and well
cared for; and that, if torn from their country, they are removed
from its idolatries and ignorance; and that the first care of a
Moslem (in this respect infinitely superior to the more polished
savages of the slave-holding States in America) is, to teach his
slave a religion which assures him that all men, of all colours,
are alike the children of one God, and equal in His eyes. All this
is true; but it in no degree lessens the horror of the traffic in
human flesh, or the privations to which its victims are
exposed.</p>

<p>Whoever knows Turkey, knows that its many provinces are only
held together by the shadow of a name,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_179">[179]</span> and that a stroke of the diplomatic pen
will suffice to sever any part from the remainder. Syria, Egypt,
even fanatic Tripoli, would hail with joy a Christian—that is, a
European—master. Wherever they rule the Turks are hated, and their
subjects are kept in subjection by a superstitious veneration for
the old power, which has long departed—as the genii waited in awe
round the throne of Solomon, not perceiving that the master spirit
had forsaken its tenement of clay. You have paid twenty millions to
liberate your slaves in the colonies; and God knows what vast
treasures—how many lives of Englishmen—have been sacrificed to stop
this trade on the western coasts of Africa! Be consistent still;
and if you will not take possession of the lands of Egypt and
Tripoli (by whose frontiers the slaves for the whole empire are
imported), let your commands go forth to him who is now but the
shadow of the shadow of God upon earth. He dare not disobey them if
he would. You will be following, in favour of humanity, an example
proposed to you in every page of Turkish history—the strong
extorting submission from the weak. Increase, if necessary, the
number of your functionaries, create an <i>imperium in imperio</i>,
to watch the execution of your orders; trample, in the cause of
freedom, upon every diplomatic form—forms, alas! are all that
remain of diplomacy<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_180">[180]</span>—and extend to the Mediterranean the
treaties which you have applied to the Atlantic.<a id=
"FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>This evening, six of my camels, which had been turned out to
feed on the scanty herbage which dotted the plain, wandered away.
They were not to be found at their supper-time; so their owners
went off in quest of them. The next morning, they had not yet
returned; and it seemed a fortunate chance alone which enabled us
to start at last about twelve o’clock. They had gone on their way
to Augila, probably not a little pleased to have left all their
packages behind them; and were met by a caravan of Arabs, coming in
the opposite direction, who, understanding the case—no unfrequent
one in places where the herbage is scanty—turned their heads
backwards. The soil had now become sandy and stony, unfit for
cultivation, but covered with dwarf shrubs of three or four
varieties, though all having one general character—woody, gnarled
stems, and fleshy leaves. The first rains are in the desert
immediately succeeded by spring; hence these plants were all green
and in full flower; some of them were very beautiful on close
inspection; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
pale yellow and pink colours of their blossoms, notwithstanding
their abundance, had little effect in tinging the general
landscape.</p>

<p>During the two days, after passing El Ajdabiah, we saw immense
herds of gazelles; but they were too shy to give one a chance of
getting within shot of them; and there was too little cover to
stalk them. The greyhound which I had with me was young, and far
too frightened to do more than run after them for a short distance;
when she thought she was getting dangerously near, she would stop,
and look round. There is a race of greyhounds peculiar to this
country, generally of a pale fawn colour, with very short hair, and
limbs almost as fine as those of the Italian pet greyhound. They
are very swift, and, when well trained, will run down a gazelle.
They are, however, not often to be met with for sale, the best
being in the hands of the Zowaya Arabs, who inhabit El Ijherri, a
small oasis to the north-east of Jalo. In winter and spring, they
pitch their tents round El Ajdabiah (it was, indeed, a party of
them who had so opportunely met our camels), and, in summer, turn
southwards to gather the dates in El Kofrah, a range of uninhabited
oases, of which the last is marked in our maps as Kebabo. The
plain, south of Benghazi, up to the desert which we were
approaching, affords excellent sport; abounding in hares, the
red-legged partridge,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_182">[182]</span> the kattah, or sand grouse with yellowish
plumage, quails, and, occasionally, the bustard. There is, besides
these, a ground lark, existing in great numbers, which is as large
as a quail, and forms no unwelcome addition to a traveller’s fare,
in the absence of larger game. I should be ungrateful, were I to
omit adding to this list of good things the juicy mushroom, which
seemed, for several days, to spring up under our feet, begging to
be gathered for supper.</p>

<p>Fourteen hours from El Ajdabiah, we came to the boundary of
vegetation; a very long range of low sand hills, rising one above
another in almost imperceptible gradations. The sand is of a pale
yellow colour, and in some places forms almost an impalpable
powder, but in others it is mixed with gravel of finely-rounded,
variegated pebbles, such as would be invaluable for the walks of a
garden. The Arab name for these hills is El-Towaleh, and they are
well called so, for they seem long without end, the gradual rise of
the range never affording a view of a mile in any direction. It
took nearly thirteen hours to cross this range—the thirteen longest
hours I remember; for, until the last two were reached, there was
no interruption to the constant up and down, through featureless
sand; nor was it possible to tell whether one had reached the
summit or not. At length, large masses of petrified wood, scattered
over the surface, afforded something to look<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_183">[183]</span> at. In many places, the surface of the
sand is blistered with an incrustation of salt, looking as if
frozen. Low, flat ledges of white limestone rise above the general
line; and semi-transparent crystals of gypsum are scattered over
the sand. A few trees appeared in a hollow, and we had at last
reached <span class="arabic" lang="ar">رسم</span> Rĕsam.</p>

<p>The waters of Rĕsam, mentioned by Bruce, are of a milky colour,
and salt, though hardly more so than those of most of the wells
which I met with afterwards in the desert; I thought them pleasant
enough to drink when cold; but they acquire a peculiarly bitter
taste when boiled. Bruce, from forgetfulness, has confounded Rĕsam
with the promontory marked as Ros Sam<a id=
"FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> in
our maps—a name, by the way, unknown<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_184">[184]</span> to the natives of the country—and the
aluminous water, which he places here, is, in fact, that of a well
rather further on; which well I reached the next day in six hours,
at Marag, or Marak. The water at Rĕsam rises in great abundance to
within a few feet from the surface; and the slight hollow in which
it lies, partaking entirely of the nature of an oasis, is
diversified by palms and large tamarisks. As a desert scene, it is
at once highly characteristic. The slight mounds which collect
round the tamarisks, and out of which they grow, break the
uniformity of the surface, while their pale, feathery foliage
affords a pleasant shade, and the few stately palm trees rise
gracefully against the clear blue sky.</p>

<p>Two miles S.S.W. of Rĕsam is a Saracenic ruin, of the same date
as El Ajdabiah, called Sheikh Es-saby, evidently a stronghold. A
square court, surrounded by four arches, which may once have
supported a cupola (though I could see no remains of this), is
supposed by the Arabs to contain the tomb of the Sheikh; and, when
I was there, a <i>carmut</i>, the cradle sort of conveyance in
which ladies and children are housed on the camel’s back, was in
the saint’s keeping. This custom of leaving furniture, and even
provisions, in the keeping of a reputed saint—that is to say, of
depositing them on his tomb—to be taken again at the return of the
owners with the caravan, is very common;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_185">[185]</span> and travellers in several parts of Africa
have mentioned it. I have never heard of such deposits being
stolen.</p>

<p>We did not stop at Marag; but I tasted the water, which was
quite clear and cool, and had a strong smell of sulphuretted
hydrogen. I did not drink of it sufficiently to test the assertion
of the Arabs, who boast of its purgative qualities; but, from its
taste and smell, I should suspect that it contains sulphate of
magnesia. The bottle, in which I had brought away a specimen of it
for analysis, was broken on the journey. At several points near the
well, the stratified rock rises in isolated masses from the sand;
their weather-beaten sides, with the slabs which have fallen, and
lie scattered round their base, have, at a slight distance, the
appearance of ruins. A few stunted trees in the midst rendered the
whole a melancholy scene.</p>

<p>The next morning the sun rose in a thick mist, like a November
fog in England. Its pale white orb could be gazed at without
wincing; below it was a luminous spot, like a second sun, and again
below this a long line of bright light rested on the horizon. At
eight the mist began to disperse, and then in the opposite side of
the heaven a distinct bow of white was visible, faintly fringed at
the lower extremities with the prismatic colours. Twenty hours of
travelling during two days, over unmitigated sand, brought us to
the skirts of the oasis of Augila. It was near sunset when
I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span> rode into the
palm-tree plantations to seek a place for the camp. The first
appearance presented to the eye by the large plantation rising in
the midst of the loose sand, was most singular. The rosy light
which coloured the ground when the sun’s rays penetrated the tall
stems, gave the part which was in shade a white appearance like
snow, which, contrasted with the bright green of the bushy young
palms, lent to the whole the appearance of a winter scene, while
the air was balmy as summer, and the bright evening sky glowed with
orange and purple tints, such as Italy or Greece cannot show. The
scene one might liken to a Flemish snow-piece seen in Naples on a
summer’s day.</p>

<p class="nind"><em>November</em> 17.—The palm groves extend for
more than three miles in a curved hollow to the town of Augila, and
nearly as much beyond it, forming almost a half circle of verdure.
The fertile part of the oasis is considerably beneath the level of
the surrounding country, so that the water being nearer the
surface, the roots of the palm trees, which pierce downwards to a
great depth, reach it, and thus obtain their nourishment. The town
is built on a slight elevation, nearly equidistant from the two
furthest points of the oasis. It is surrounded by a thin mud wall,
some twelve feet high, but not more than nine or ten inches thick;
this wall is in a most delapidated condition, in several places
entirely destroyed, and in others worn into innumerable holes. Six
gate towers of equally substantial architecture give entrance to
the long and tortuous lanes of the capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>Sheikh
Othman-el-Fadil, the hereditary Sheikh of Augila, and the Kehia who
happened to be in the town, came to my tent as soon as I arrived.
The former I had seen in Benghazi, and he showed me every
attention, convenient and inconvenient, in his power, by way,
probably, of asserting his right to the family name, which means
“the complaisant.” I returned the Governor’s visit, and thus had an
opportunity of seeing “the castle,” which is situated near the
great mosque—a not less ruinous structure than the external walls.
It is composed of several very small courts with recesses, which
serve as sleeping or store rooms; the open court, in which are
mastabahs—mud divans covered with carpets—is the place of
reception. The Governor either could not or would not tell me the
number of inhabitants, or even of the houses, saying they were
written in the Deftar, the domesday-book of Benghazi; and, in fact,
he seemed quite determined that it should not be in my power to
quote him as giving any information dangerous to the State.</p>

<p>I looked into the principal mosque in passing; like all the
other buildings it is of mud and small stones, with many low
columns and arches of the same material; the roof being formed of
small conical cupolas like sugar loaves, some of which are four
feet in diameter, and eight or ten in height. This is the
consecrated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span> style
of building for the mosques, of which there are fourteen. From the
best information I could obtain, it seemed that the number of
inhabited houses was under 500. The Kehia, an Arab of Benghazi,
only comes here once a year, and then to collect the tribute; his
visit ended, the Wagily, as the inhabitants of Augila are called,
are left to follow their own devices. The Sheikh has a
traditionary, but no legal authority; if crimes occur, his duty is
to report them to the Bey of Benghazi, and wait for orders before
sending the offenders with the witnesses to the Bey for judgment.
Of course, with such a system, the only check upon crime and
violence is in the natural disposition of the people, or in the
fear of blood feuds; recourse is, indeed, rarely or never had to
the distant and doubtful justice thus to be sought in Benghazi.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of these oases indulge greatly in a
slightly-intoxicating drink, derived from the palm tree. Sheikh
Othman, who himself professes not to indulge in this forbidden
luxury, was so obliging as to take me to one of his gardens to see
the method by which it is obtained. The tree is stripped of its
branches, and the crown cut off, so as to lay bare the heart; a
small drain is then cut in the edge, to which the mouth of a jar is
applied, and for months the tree yields its daily tribute of
<i>lagby</i>. From time to time the crust is cut from the wound to
facilitate the flow of the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_190">[190]</span> juice; for this purpose an instrument is
used, in shape like a horse fleam, tied at right angles to a handle
of wood. After three or four months, the wound is generally closed;
the tree does not yield fruit for some years after this exhausting
process, and will die if the wound be left too long open. It seemed
to me, however, that the tree never recovers its stately
appearance, but ever in after life has a debauched, drunken look
about its branches, indicative of its former intemperate habits.
The drink itself is of a milky white colour; on the first day it is
drawn, it is sweet, like the milk of the cocoa-nut; on the second,
acid and slightly vinous; and, on the third, it is already vinegar.
Though drinkable in large draughts in the second stage, when it has
only a slightly acid taste, it is still a poor substitute for the
smallest small beer. The Wagily are rich in about 16,000 date
trees, and their gardens produce gourds, melons, tomatos, and
onions, with a small quantity of kesab and barley.</p>

<p>I next day continued my journey to Jalo, where I hoped to make
arrangements for my further progress. On the same day that I left
Benghazi, a Turk, dependant on the Kaimahan, set off for Jalo, to
take the census of the date trees, on which the taxes are levied;
the result of the last one having been unsatisfactory to a large
party of the inhabitants. He was accompanied by Yunes, one of the
sheikhs, who had given<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_191">[191]</span> me every promise of assistance, though not
disguising the difficulty I should probably find in pursuing my
original plan, which was to go to the Koffra, and thence eastwards
towards the Nile. Such a route was quite new to the Majabra, and no
one would venture to join me in exploring it; I could not even find
any one willing to accompany me to Gebabo, <span class="arabic"
lang="ar">كبابو</span>. The Zowayah had already returned; after
whom parties of Tibbus often visit these oases to glean the fruit
which remains on the date trees.</p>

<p>Jalo, 28 miles, or eight hours E.S.E. from Augila, is by far the
most important in this group of oases; the name, now restricted to
the first, was probably in ancient times applied to the whole
group. The oases, according to the earliest accounts we have of
them, contained no fixed inhabitants; the Libyan nomads paid them a
summer visit to gather dates, in the same way that the Zowayah now
go to the Koffra. In the time of the Roman domination of Africa,
they contained a small settlement, which, probably, had been formed
to meet the necessities of the caravans. Jalo is approached by a
hollow, bordered on each side by rows of tamarisks, which gradually
opens into a plain, bounded by low sand hills. On two of them,
facing each other, Leb <span class="arabic" lang="ar">لب</span> and
El’Erg <span class="arabic" lang="ar">العرق</span>, two villages of
much humbler pretensions than Augila, are built. Each contains a
few mud houses, but the dwellings are<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_192">[192]</span> mostly huts (zeribah), constructed of palm
branches, generally of a conical form, eight or nine feet in
diameter, and rarely more than seven high at the apex. The mosques
are mere square mud structures, without any attempt at ornament;
and, instead of walls and gate-towers, a simple palisading of palm
branches surrounds each village. Jalo is, however, more populous
than Augila, and a far greater degree, not of comfort—this is
unknown in such places—but of <i>bien être</i>, is found here. This
arises not only from the great extent of its palm groves, but
principally from the occupation of its inhabitants, who are all
merchants. They are of different origin from the Wagily, some
speaking Arabic, whilst others, both in appearance and language,
preserve the Berber type. El’Erg contains 4000 inhabitants,
allowing five to a family, which is rather above than below the
average; it contains seven mosques, distinguished only by little
white flags, and is governed by twelve sheikhs. Leb, which is but
half this size, rejoices in only three sheikhs and as many
mosques.</p>

<p>I encamped in the plain between the two villages, where I found
Hafiz Effendi’s tent already pitched; he had chosen this central
position by way of proving his impartiality, for there is, of
course, great rivalry between the two places. I took my ground
between two large clumps of tamarisks (ef-teleh), the only
vegetation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span> which
the plain presented; their graceful foliage affords a relief to the
eye, the small crystals of salt with which it is covered giving it
an ashy gray colour; here, then, was an imperfect representation of
the three Turkish elements of happiness—a bright eye, a green
shade, and a running stream. The tamarisk clumps were the only
variety in the monotonous yellow which surrounded me on every side,
for the date groves are only visible at a distance in one
direction. It would be possible to render the whole of this plain
productive, but the Majabra have too little taste for agriculture
to take the necessary trouble. About three feet beneath the sand is
found a layer of whitish clay, which, when uncovered and watered,
yields crops of barley, wheat, and a few vegetables; but the labour
required for this is great. The people are addicted to an idle
roving life, and as the date-trees produce abundant harvests,
almost without care, other cultivation is very much neglected. The
dates are of an inferior quality to those of Augila, but they
afford the principal article of food, not only to man, but also for
all his dependent quadrupeds. Horses, dogs, camel, sheep, are all
put on this same regimen, which Sheikh Yunes pretended was a very
wholesome one, but the blackened jagged teeth, universal here,
seemed to contradict him.</p>

<p>The palm groves which surround Jalo contain upwards<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span> of 100,000 trees, the tax upon
each of which is four Turkish piastres. The former census only
counted 45,000, but the new one, which is now going on, will raise
this number to 65,000, an increase of taxation produced by the
complaints of the people themselves, who are now, as may be
supposed, furious at their own stupidity. For several evenings
after the census began, when the people saw the turn it was likely
to take, the women of the two villages assembled after dark and
filled the air, in alternate chorus, with yelling curses upon Hafiz
Effendi. He allowed them the uninterrupted enjoyment of this female
form of respectful remonstrance, and after a few nights, either
from hoarseness or disgust at finding their eloquence disregarded,
this expression of public opinion was abandoned. I went two or
three times to see the method adopted for taking the census;
nothing could be simpler or more tedious. The commissioners,
surrounded by all the fifteen sheikhs, and the greater part of the
proprietors, male and female, of the plantation they were visiting,
went from place to place, counting and recounting the trees. Every
artifice was put in practice to distract their attention, or to
puzzle the commissioners as to ownership; indeed, this latter was
no difficult matter, for many trees have three or four owners, or
one man’s property is dispersed here and there, through the whole
oasis. A good date-tree will<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_195">[195]</span> yield three hundredweight of fruit on
alternate years; the produce being generally smaller in the
intervening year. As dates are worth about 20 piastres a
hundredweight, the tax is about a tithe of the produce.</p>

<p>The wells of Jalo are all brackish, and the nearest sweet water
is at a distance of six hours; hither, at rare intervals, the
ladies of the place resort to wash the cotton shirts and woollen
plaids, which are the costume of their lords. The scanty fauna is
confined to the fox, wolf, or jackal, fovina and gerboa. There are
snakes, which are said to be venomous and of large size, but though
I offered backshish I could obtain no specimens of them, either
here or at Augila. Some exuviæ, which I found in a quarry near my
tent, at the latter place, proved the fact of their existence and
their size. Of antiquities I could learn nothing; the subterranean
temple, with a cubical idol, mentioned by some writer, the oldest
inhabitants had never heard of, and the only curiosity which they
could point out to me, was a single large hewn stone, about four
miles south-west of El’Erg, under which they suppose a treasure to
be concealed.</p>

<p>The Majabra are, almost without exception, addicted to excessive
drinking, owing, no doubt, to the facility of procuring
<i>lagby</i>. At an early age they commence their apprenticeship in
trade by journeys to Benghazi, soon followed by longer courses
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span> Egypt and
Fezzan. They are the great slave-dealers of these countries,
purchasing their human merchandise in Fezzan, from wholesale
dealers, many of whom are Majabra settled there. The latter make
every year an incursion into Bornou, and return with troops of five
or six hundred slaves, which they afterwards sell in retail to the
men of Jalo. The most valuable black slaves are called Fellatah;
they have nearly straight hair, and their features bear little of
the negro type. Their distinctive mark is three slashes on the
cheeks and two on the temples. The gains in this trade are very
large, and many of the Jalese have amassed in it large sums; which
sums, however, they have no means of spending. The women are
generally unveiled, wearing a long blue shirt and a milayah on the
head, like the fellah women in Egypt; they enjoy a good reputation
for purity of morals.</p>

<p>Finding myself obliged to renounce all hopes of going to the
Koffra, I contented myself with gathering such information as I
could from those who had been there. The nearest oasis is distant
six days’ journey, over a flat sandy desert, unbroken by rock or
shrub, and having no wells. The remaining ones are respectively at
a good day’s journey from each other; the furthest and largest,
Gebabo, <span class="arabic" lang="ar">قبابوا</span>, being
considered twelve days distant. These oases are totally
uninhabited, except in autumn, when the Zowayah<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span> proceed from their summer
station, Ijherri, in a body to gather the dates and figs, which
grow there in wild luxuriance. They are represented as abounding in
sweet water, which is obtained in large quantities by merely
scratching a hole in the sand. I was assured that the Koffra
contained no monument of antiquity, and were mere fertile spots,
like some I should see on my journey to the east, inhabited only by
the jackal and wild cow. The Tibbus, as far as I could learn, are a
timid and inoffensive people, not possessing fire-arms, and, except
for the pilgrimage (they are Moslemin), never visiting Jalo or
Siwah. With Fezzan they carry on an insignificant trade, chiefly in
dromedaries (of which they have an excellent breed) and sulphur,
which they exchange on the frontier for cotton, cloths, and
beads.</p>

<p>The caravans arriving from Waday reach Gebabo in about forty-two
days from Warah, and having come twelve without water, their camels
are so exhausted that they stop here, and send to Jalo to hire
camels to continue the journey to Benghazi; there they generally
spend six months, buying cottons, coral, paper, and, I think, arms.
The Sultan of Waday is himself the proprietor of the greater part
of the caravan, and in the long intervals between its visits, the
Frank merchants lay in stores of such curiosities or elegancies as
his Wadayan majesty is likely to be pleased with.<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span> I heard of a plated dinner
service, which had been ordered by one of them, in hopes the
caravan might arrive this year; at its last departure it conveyed a
carriage to him. The Sultan is said to have began to coin dollars
from a die sent to him from Europe; up to a very recent time the
entire circulation was in Spanish dollars, and writing paper served
in lieu of smaller coins. A fowl is bought with a sheet of writing
paper, six or eight are paid for a sheep—the most original paper
currency. The country is said to be rich in pasturage and arable
land, and two mountains yield copper and iron. No European having
ever visited Waday, its other mineral and vegetable riches are
unknown, though a small quantity of gold dust is collected either
within its frontiers or from the countries to the south. The Sultan
claims to be a sheikh of the family of the Abassides, and was for
many years a refugee in Cairo, where he learned to appreciate the
arts of civilisation. If he still reign, it is not improbable that
a European would be warmly welcomed at his court, but no one could
venture there without having previously obtained his consent. While
in Jalo I heard rumours from Fezzan, to the effect, that he had
grown blind, and had been deposed by his son, a blood-thirsty
tyrant, who soon made himself so hateful to his vizirs and
influential men, that they reinstated the father, who is now only a
puppet in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span> the hands
of one of the rival factions warring for the sovereignty. Should
these news be confirmed, or in the doubts which they suggest, no
one could prudently venture into Waday.<a id=
"FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>The Turkish Government levies at Jalo heavy duties upon the
produce of Waday, 25 dollars on the cantar of ivory (98 lbs.)—a sum
more than its original value, and one dollar a head upon the
slaves, upon whom a further duty of seven dollars and a half is
charged at Benghazi. Those shipped for Constantinople, however, go
duty free, the supply of so necessary a commodity for the capital
being encouraged in every possible way. The Wadayan slaves are
amongst the least intelligent negroes in Africa, and have the
reputation of being thievishly inclined; they are, therefore, the
cheapest, but the profit on their sale is very great, their value
at Warah hardly exceeding a dollar and a half.</p>

<p>Jalo was decidedly not an amusing residence, and my impatience
to continue my journey, when I found that I could only reach Egypt
by way of Siwah, was not diminished by the delays which I half
suspected my friend Yunes of occasioning. In this I did
him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span> injustice, for,
even if he intentionally sought means to put off my departure,
after-occurrences lead me to think that he did this in my interest;
of his good-will I had no idea at the time, and I only felt annoyed
at being detained, and certain that some intrigue was at the bottom
of it. He, every day, expected the arrival of his son, who was on
his way from Fezzan with a few slaves for the Egyptian market, and
he wished me to accompany him. For this I had little inclination,
having no wish to join a slave caravan, and, above all, desiring to
be master of my own movements—<i>Hoc amo quod possum quâlibet ire
viâ</i>.</p>

<p>I had long exhausted every topic of information upon which the
Jalese could enlighten me, and my only amusement now were the rare
visits of the Sheikh and Hafiz Effendi. At whatever hour they came,
the coffee which was given to them was never the only refreshment
they reckoned upon being treated to, and they never failed to ask
for something stronger. I was provided with a small stock of rum
for such a contingency, being well aware that many of the Turkish
<i>employés</i> are eager votaries of the bottle; but, before my
departure from Jalo, my friends had completely exhausted my stock;
when they had done so, I may add, their visits became less
frequent. Besides drinking in my tent—not in my company, for I
never joined them—they thought nothing of asking for a<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span> bottle with which to indulge
in a private kef in their own quarters—glad to make something out
of the Frank; they could not plead the excuse of the bottle being a
rarity to them, as they were in constant communication with
Benghazi, where the forbidden drink is plentiful. With us it is
shameful for a man out of his teens to be seen drunk; with them it
is only a sin. One day, during my stay at Grennah, the secretary to
the Government, said to be a most upright man, came to see me; he
drank, before, during, and after dinner, Marsala and brandy to such
an extent, that when, at last, wearied with his meaningless
loquacity, I insisted upon his going to bed in the tent I had
prepared for him, he fell flat in the attempt to rise from the
couch, breaking the bottles he had just emptied; and then it was
with difficulty that he allowed himself to be put to bed by one of
my servants. The next day he alluded, without an appearance of
shame, to his evening’s exploit, saying, if any damage was done, it
was not he but the wine that did it. The great object in getting
drunk, (kef they call it,) is to procure the soundness of sleep
which follows, and hence the pleasantest liquor, in their
estimation, is that which has the speediest effect.</p>

<p>I was, in fact, thoroughly tired of my stay in Jalo; and what
rendered it particularly exasperating was the persuasion which
every day took more strongly hold<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_202">[202]</span> of me—that I was the victim of a
speculation, on the part of these people, to detain me, until,
tired of waiting, I should be ready to subscribe to any terms they
chose to offer me. This idea only made me more determined to refuse
what I knew to be an exorbitant demand. Hafiz Effendi possessed no
authority, and Yunes, if he had any, did not, as I thought, exert
it. After concluding a bargain for camels, at nearly a third more
than the usual price, my men returned the next morning and tried to
extort another dollar; this I refused, and no one, naturally
enough, would incur the ill-will of his people in defence of a
stranger, by obliging them to stick to their bargain. Consequently,
in a fit of unreasonable disgust—unreasonable, for it is always
better to put up with such annoyances in travelling than to subject
oneself to fresh and perhaps more serious ones, only to give proof
of a resolution which people cannot appreciate—I sent off to Augila
to ask Shiekh Othman to provide me with camels to return there, and
to look out for others for my further journey. I had now been a
month in Jalo, and on comparing my expenditure with the state of my
purse, I discovered to my dismay that, thanks to the dearness of
everything here, I could not start without sending to my good
friend Mr. Xerri, in Benghazi, for a fresh supply of the needful. I
must do Yunes the justice to say, that when I announced my
determination,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span> he
did all he could to dissuade me from it, offering me, after the
things were already packed for the return to Augila, money, camels,
anything. He felt that I had come there in a sort of way as his
guest, and that leaving him as I did was a slur upon his
hospitality. I persisted, however, in my determination, and in the
end was punished for it as I deserved. I never yet opposed myself
to an imposition, that I did not end by submitting to at least as
great a one, and having all the annoyance without the glory of
martyrdom into the bargain. After each lesson I promise myself to
consult, in future, my real convenience, throwing abstract notions
of justice to the dogs on the next occasion, but I rarely, when the
temptation comes, am able to resist it.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">With</span> bitter maledictions
against the fathers of all the Majabra, I saw my luggage loaded to
return to Augila, and then started with a single servant for the
district called Ijherri, <span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">إِجهرّي</span>, eighteen miles to the north-east. It is a
large village of square palm-branch huts, lying in the midst of
date-trees, and is almost deserted at the present moment, as not a
dozen persons remain in it during the winter; its situation among
trees renders it more picturesque than either Jalo or Augila, and
the trees themselves are remarkable as the first specimens I had
seen of untrimmed, perfectly wild date-trees. The Arabs are too
lazy to pay the slight attention to the cultivation of the trees
which the Wagily pay to theirs; and on many of them the dead boughs
of the last twenty years could be seen drooping in a thick fringe
round their stems. I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_205">[205]</span> found that the very few people who still
lingered behind the rest of their tribes, were inveterate
<i>lagby</i> drinkers, and had stayed behind to indulge in their
favourite vice.</p>

<p>The next day I turned backwards south-west to Augila, where I
was warmly welcomed by Sheikh Othman, who could not conceal his
pleasure at my applying to him, in preference to taking camels from
Yunes. There had been an old feud between them when Othman’s father
was Sheikh of Jalo as well as Augila; the Majabra, however,
revolted from his authority, applied to the Pacha of Tripoli, and
obtained an independent government, but not before Yunes, with some
of his friends, had waylaid and murdered their old sheikh. How the
quarrel was made up I shall afterwards have occasion to tell.
Othman pretended that I was not the first victim of the insolence
of the Majabra, as the last Turkish commissioners of the census had
been treated still worse, and had only been enabled to return to
Benghazi through his means. Othman el Fadil is a perfect specimen
of an African Sheikh-el-bilad, the most despicable combination of
cringing servility and insolent tyranny that barbarism has
produced. These good qualities in him are combined with extreme
cunning and no small amount of natural talent. After being
despoiled of his hereditary authority, he made shift to repossess
himself of it; he even<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_206">[206]</span> managed to resist the authority of the
Turkish Pacha of Tripoli, after the deprivation of the last native
Governor; and he now contrives by art rather than violence to
maintain himself in his position. He is probably wealthy, for half
the cultivated land in the oasis belongs to him, and he has also
possessions in Jalo and in Fezzan. As a proof of his shrewdness, I
may mention, that since the death of the last Cadi, which took
place fifteen years ago, he has persuaded the people to do without
this functionary, so that all marriages and other contracts are now
made in his presence. He gains immensely in influence by this
arrangement, and the people probably do not lose by it; for as the
appointment of the Cadi is in the hands of the Cadi of Tripoli, who
buys his office in Constantinople, and as he in turn sells all the
posts depending upon him, it is not improbable that the purchaser
sells the justice he dispenses.</p>

<p>During my long stay here, his attentions were, after his
fashion, unceasing; he rarely omitted paying at least one visit a
day to my tent, and frequently sent supplies of vegetables, or
fresh baked bread, or new drawn <i>lagby</i>, for all which he took
care to exact handsome payment, asking for and carrying off
everything he saw which struck his fancy, which was a most
miscellaneous one. He pretended that he could speak four of the
languages of the interior, as well as Turkish,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_207">[207]</span> but I never could induce him to let me
see the vocabulary of them, which he said he had drawn up; more
than once I had, in other matters, occasion to admire the
liveliness of his imagination, so that he may very possibly be
mistaken in his assertions. Whatever the amount of his learning, it
is unquestioned by his subjects, who look up to him as a prodigy of
wisdom. He was particularly fond of taking a peep through my
sextant, and of astonishing any of his people who might be in the
tent, by giving them explanations of the use of the “Astrolabe,”
which would have astonished Hadley, and been new to Sawitsch.</p>

<p>Time wore slowly away at Augila, and the fifteen days, before
whose expiration I had been assured my messenger would have
returned from Benghazi, had passed without bringing any news of
him. A dull Christmas was to be expected in such a heathen place;
but what I was not prepared for was the extreme cold of the nights,
during which the thermometer sometimes sank to zero; and in the
long evening, from dark till bedtime, I occasionally had as much
difficulty in keeping out the cold, as in finding occupation. The
Wagily, unless there be a <i>fantasia</i> on foot, go early to bed,
and the Sheikh’s conversation was not sufficiently instructive to
make me wish for his company; he was shy of speaking about the
customs of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span> his
people, and they seem to have preserved no tradition of their
origin or former history.</p>

<p>I have already described the oasis of Augila as extending in a
half circle of about six miles in a hollow, around the foot of a
range of compacted sand lying over a white limestone. In this space
is comprised a large tract of brown morass, covered with a crust of
saline earth, beneath which are bitter waters. Such a morass is
described by Beechey on the coast of the Syrtis, and I had reason
to respect the propriety of the warning given him by his guide, as
only a yard from the path which runs across it the thin crust gave
way under my horse, who began to flounder, and was only able by a
violent effort to extricate himself. In general, the water of the
wells in Augila is very good; the salt which it contains being
almost imperceptible to a person accustomed to that of Jalo.</p>

<p>I had encamped on a hill used as a burial-ground, to the east of
the town, and water was drawn for me from a well close at hand,
which was used to water one of the Sheikh’s fields. I was
astonished one morning, soon after I arrived, by finding the water
of my sponge bath sensibly warm, and, on inquiry, I found that,
instead of standing as usual all night ready for use, it had only
just been drawn from the well. The thermometer, when immersed in
it, showed, two hours after sunrise, a temperature of 74°, while
the external air<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
was 52°. Many of the wells have this degree of warmth; others are
quite cold, and these are either brackish or very salt. At some
distance from the modern town, following the inside of the curve of
plantations and to the left of it, there are in a small field some
remains of reticulated brickwork, and the ground in the
neighbourhood is full of broken pottery. What remains is too little
to authorise a conjecture as to its use.</p>

<p>Augila is on the caravan road from Fezzan to Egypt and Benghazi;
the intermediate stations between Augila and Murzuk are Maradah, an
oasis three days distant, and Zalla as much further on. At an hour
and a half, on the road to Maradah, which follows a north-west
direction in leaving Augila, I found, at a considerable elevation
above the cultivated land, a number of small groups of rock of
volcanic origin, forming an irregular oval like the remains of a
crater. The rocks are gray and black lava, as heavy and compact as
basalt. Ten hours before reaching Maradah, <span class="arabic"
lang="ar">مَراَده</span>, there is a small oasis, Jabna,
<span class="arabic" lang="ar">جَبْنه</span>, and two hours further
Hairaigab, <span class="arabic" lang="ar">حيَريَقه</span>, both
inhabited by Arabs of the tribes of Hamud and Zowayah. In Maradah
there is one of those curious wells whose water contains a salt,
doubtless of iron, which imparts to it the property of dyeing
cotton and woollen cloths<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_210">[210]</span> black. I think it is Belzoni who mentions
the existence of such a spring in the little oasis, without,
however, stating that the stuff to be dyed is first boiled in a
decoction of bark. There is another well of the same kind in
Fezzan, at a place called Agar, which, like this one at Maradah, is
called ’Ain essobagh, or the Dyer’s Well. At Zalla tame ostriches
are kept in the houses, and it must be in this way that the finer
feathers, imported into Europe, are obtained, for those of birds
killed in the chase and brought to market, are almost always soiled
and broken. A Fezzan Fikhy, who came to me while in Siwah, supplied
me with one other fact concerning Fezzan: the place where sulphur
is found is called Wady ’ain Ghadga (<span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">غدقه</span>), near a hill called ’Angud (<span class="arabic"
lang="ar">عنقود</span>), ten days east of Murzuk.</p>

<p>Whilst I was in Augila two marriages took place, one of them
that of the Sheikh (only his thirteenth) with the daughter of my
friend Yunes. She was old and a widow; the only attraction I could
discover seemed to be the relation in which their respective
fathers had stood to each other, of which I have already spoken.
The festivities were commenced, some evenings before the marriage,
with the loud shrill cries of women, accompanied by occasional
musket shots. On inquiry, I was told that all the female friends of
the bridegroom were assembled in his house,<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_211">[211]</span> each bringing her mill to help in
grinding wheat to make bread for the marriage feast. The usual
quantity ground is from six to eight hundredweight, but sometimes,
if the Sheikh might be believed, as much as eighty hundredweight is
consumed on such occasions. This bread is partly sent to the houses
of the principal people, like our old-fashioned wedding-cake, and
partly eaten at the feast, which consists chiefly of dates and
large supplies of <i>lagby</i>.</p>

<p>The evening before the wedding, the young men and boys of the
village assembled with all the donkeys which they could procure,
and, loading them with fine sand from the hill where I was
encamped, brought it to the bridal house, and strewed it in the
rooms. In the intervals between the departure and return of the
donkeys, the boys who remained danced to the sound of their own
voices and the beating of a drum; this drum is made of a circle of
wood about the size of a tambourine, on each side of which a
gazelle-skin is stretched; it is beaten with a knotted rope. The
first marriage was that of a young girl, a relation of Othman’s,
but as she belonged to the town, there was nothing remarkable in
the bridal procession: it was, as usual, accompanied by the
Zaghaghit and firing of guns. The arrival of the Sheikh’s bride
with a <i>cortège</i>, including all the men in the place, but none
of her own relations,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_212">[212]</span> was a much more solemn affair. She was
carried in state in a closely-veiled carmout, covered with white
cotton hangings, round which an old red silk scarf was tied; a man
on horseback preceded her, carrying a white flag. When the
<i>cortège</i> arrived in sight of the town, several halts were
made, during which there were rude dancing, firing of muskets, and
evolutions of the three or four horsemen whom the place furnished.
While the lady was thus being brought in procession to her new
home, the gallant bridegroom was quietly seated in my tent looking
on, and it was not until the <i>cortège</i> entered the town that
he betook himself to his house.</p>

<p>Here, when the camel knelt at the door, before the howdah
containing its precious burthen was removed from its back, a
sheep’s throat was cut over its right knee, in manner of sacrifice.
The Sheikh, after many ineffectual hints which I would not
understand, at last boldly begged of me a sash woven with gold
which he had one day see me wear; this he wished to form part of
the corbeil, and in letting him have it I took the opportunity of
inspecting the ornaments destined for the bride. They consisted of
two pairs of broad silver bands to be worn as bracelets, weighing
respectively ten and fourteen ounces, and a pair of very curious
silver earrings of Tunis make. They were in shape like the young
moon, two inches and a half in diameter,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_213">[213]</span> two-thirds of the circumference being
covered with filigree bosses, from which five pear-shaped filigree
pendents hung, each earring weighing 160 grammes. I felt a great
curiosity to see the cartilage capable of supporting such a weight.
The marriage feast was diversified by dancing to the sound of the
drum, and a curious double clarionet, formed of the leg bones of
the eagle or vulture, which discoursed sweet music in the tone of a
very broken-winded bagpipe. The dancing, like that of the Egyptian
Alnach (in whom youth, good looks, and sex hardly excuse the
peculiar style), was here performed by a hideous man, and was
utterly disgusting. When the bride had entered the house, the
festivities were terminated by a discharge of fire-arms, and the
company retired, to meet again the next evening, and to renew the
eating and dancing.</p>

<p>It is no uncommon thing to find men in these countries who have
married twenty or thirty times, the sum given for a wife rarely
exceeding six or eight dollars. When tired of a spouse, or if she
do not prove fruitful, a divorce follows as a matter of course, and
the lady does not suffer in general estimation; having borne
children seems to be no protection against the caprice of the men.
This licence is utterly opposed to Turkish habits, for divorce is
more disreputable to<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_214">[214]</span> a man among the Osmanli than with us, but
the assertors of the rights of women in Europe would find this
régime very congenial to their theories, for a woman can always
force her husband to a divorce, even without laying her slipper at
the Cadi’s feet.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">January</span> 13.—My messenger
returned several days ago from Benghazi; and Sheikh Othman had a
fortnight before assured me that the camels were ready to start
with me at a moment’s warning; and then again, after several days’
delay, had promised them for this morning, but I saw nothing of
them. At length, on Saturday morning, Othman, accompanied by
several other persons, came to see the baggage tied up and
weighed—a long operation, which I hastened as much as I could,
being anxious to get away from a place of which I was heartily
tired. Where were the camels all this time? They were at the other
end of the town, and would be brought up immediately; but as soon
as all seemed in order for starting, my friend Othman went off,
saying, that we should start with the dawn next morning. I was
completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span> in his
power, and had nothing for it but to take patience, and the more
so, since I now found that the camel owners—with whom I had only
communicated through my trusty friend, and to whom he, in his
anxiety to serve me, had promised an exorbitant hire on my
part—were, in fact, himself and one of his friends. I consoled
myself with the idea of taking it out of him by suppressing the
backshish I had intended to give him; but this was poor consolation
for the previous days thus lost.</p>

<p><em>Sunday, Jan.</em> 16.—The sun had been up for more than
three hours before the camels came, and then there were only six
instead of nine. These I had loaded and dispatched by a little
after midday, having been promised that the others should be sent
to me in half an hour. Hour after hour went by, and I sat fretting
among the remains of my baggage; at length the day wearing on, I
determined to follow the camels which had already started, leaving
a servant to come on with the rest as soon as they arrived. I had
found out from the people of the place, that the men with whom the
original bargain was made had been sent away, as the Sheikh,
finding he could make so profitable an investment, had determined
to supply the greater number of camels himself; he had not,
however, yet purchased them all—and hence the delay.</p>

<p>Half an hour before sunset, no camels appearing, I<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span> mounted my horse and rode off
alone, to seek for my caravan, and—what I was beginning to feel a
great want of—my dinner. The road was over gravelly sand, and as
long as daylight lasted it was easy enough to follow the tracks of
the camels; but as night closed in, and the sky became overcast
with fleecy clouds, which obscured the moon and stars, the track
gradually grew invisible, and I could only guess at the right path;
so keeping my horse’s head as straight as possible, I rode on.
There was no appearance of fire in any direction, and after four
hours I found myself among palm-trees, which I recognised as those
of Jalo. It would have been folly to attempt to return to find the
road I had deviated from, in the darkness, and it was too late to
ask for hospitality in Jalo; I, therefore, tied my horse to a tree,
and lay down supperless and hungry under a palm-bush near him. I
was soon asleep; but, tormented with thirst, I dreamed of the
gurgling streams of Damascus, and the water-sellers in the streets
of Cairo, with their leaf-crowned jars of cool water. Their cry,
“God’s fountain for the thirsty,” awoke me, and the first sound I
heard was the rumbling of water in a vase. “Oh, man,” I cried,
“bring water.” There was no answer, as my voice fell echoless in
the still night, and I turned again to sleep, thinking I had
dreamed; but in another moment I again heard the<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span> sound, and this time I was
sure I was awake. I sat up and listened; presently the noise was
repeated, and then I heard the pawing of my horse, and felt the
branches of the bush I was lying under shaken. I rose, and found
that my horse, thirsty as his master, and more sagacious than he,
had nosed out a vase of <i>lagby</i> among the branches; the
booming noise which had awoke me being caused by his ineffectual
attempts to get his head into a jar which had an orifice of about
an inch. My thirst in the meantime had increased with my dream, and
setting aside all sense of the impropriety of theft. I took a
draught of the cool palm-juice, which, for the first time, seemed
to me a pleasant beverage, and again lay down, after replacing the
jar and tying my horse in a position to prevent his repeating his
vain addresses to the bottle.</p>

<p>In the gray of the morning, I mounted with the intention of
retracing my steps and joining my caravan, but just as I emerged
from the palm trees, I saw two men and a camel coming from Augila.
At this sight my malignant star suggested to me the idea of saving
time, and not returning on my way—a bad omen in the beginning of a
journey; so I rode up to the new comers, asking if either would
accompany me to the Wadi, the place of rendezvous for caravans
starting to Siwah; and one of them saying he knew the way, agreed
to guide me. I knew that my servant, when he<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_219">[219]</span> saw the camels arrive without me, would
at once conclude that I had ridden straight to the Wadi, and
without a misgiving I rode on. I had eaten nothing since an early
breakfast on the previous day, and when midday came and we were
still far from the Wadi, I turned to see what store of good things
my saddlebags contained. I found in them only a single sea-biscuit.
Of this I gave half to my conductor, and, unable to make any
impression on what remained, I reserved it till my arrival in the
Wadi. We reached it at half-past two, but there was no appearance
of the Cafilah, and I now began to contemplate with some dismay the
possibility of the Ottoman having again broken his word, and having
another day to wait with my not abundant store of provisions. There
was at least water here, and this was all I had to give my horse
and dog; my tarboush served to draw it, and for them to drink out
of. The Wadi was here and there dotted with tufts of a
bright-looking thorny grass, and to enable him to pick up a few
mouthfuls, and at the same time prevent him from going far off, I
tied my horse’s forelegs together, and sent him to look for his
dinner.</p>

<p>Meantime my guide had made me a fire, which he lighted from the
smouldering embers left by a caravan, which must have started a few
hours before we came up; and I then dismissed him, showing the half
biscuit which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
remained, as a good reason for his not staying with me, while I
assured him that my people could not be long in coming up. Evening
was fast approaching, so I ate half the remainder of my biscuit
soaked in water, gathered sticks to feed my fire, and choosing the
sheltered side of a palm-bush, looked to my arms and arranged my
saddle and saddle-cloth, so as to make something which I persuaded
myself was a bed. I had not even a cloak, as in a fit of
carefulness for my steed I had removed it to save him the weight,
never reckoning on such a contingency as the present; the only
additional covering I had to the white trowsers and jacket I wore,
was one of those light india-rubber overcoats, bearing a
barbarously meaningless name, such as the classic public of the
Strand delights in. The sky was bright and clear, and the air
proportionately cold. I had no provisions, no wine, no brandy, no
covering, not even a cigar, but I had a chronometer, a sextant, a
compass, a thermometer, a telescope, in fact a whole observatory of
instruments to console me for the want of a dinner, and I was thus
enabled to certify, that at dawn the thermometer marked 43°; and
the sharp air, contrasted with the heat of the sun during the
previous day, made this seem still more piercingly cold.</p>

<p>In one point at least I am a true Englishman, for I can brook
anything better than the want of my<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_221">[221]</span> “victuals;” next to this the most painful
feeling I know is that of inaction. I had had enough of my two
days’ fast, and in the morning I thought to avoid further endurance
of either evil by mounting my poor horse and going back, somewhere
or other; my ambition in fact was to keep moving. The old gray,
knowing my temper pretty well, after an eight months’ acquaintance,
had probably foreseen this; he woke me half a dozen times during
the night by rubbing his nose against my legs, by way of asking how
I felt, and at last getting some cross words for disturbing me, had
made himself scarce. As far as the telescope could command he was
not to be seen, and I was in no humour for a tramp in search of him
through the loose sand. The morning wore heavily, a quarter of my
biscuit still remained, but I reserved it with an idea of keeping
rather than eating my cake, while from time to time I took a look
to see if “anybody was coming.” At last I saw a spot moving in the
distance, a single man, but so wrapped in his borneau that I could
not distinguish him. He came straight towards me, and then I
recognised him as my guide of the previous day, who had brought me
a basket of dates, some corn for my horse, and two pieces of stick
to kindle a fire. I sat down on the sand with the basket before me,
he sitting in true Arab style of hospitality at a little distance
to see me eat, and while I<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_222">[222]</span> picked out a few dates without relish
(appetite was gone, and I fancied them dirty), he told me why he
had returned. It was midnight when he reached his cottage in Jalo;
his mother got up, made him a fire, and gave him something to eat
while he told her how he had spent his day. He then lay down to
sleep, but his mother said to him, “My son, this is no time for
sleep; my heart is troubled for the man in the Wadi; rise and go to
him, for he is alone, and I fear robbers; carry him these dates,
for he is hungry.” Abd-er-rahman started afresh and reached me
about ten in the morning, having hardly rested during forty-eight
hours. When he had seen me eat, he went to the well and washed, and
then employed himself in gathering date-stones in the sand round
the fire-places of previous caravans. I was puzzled to see him thus
groping in the earth, and visions of truffles, which I had read of
in Theophrastus as being found in this desert, rose before me. Were
I given to the vice of <i>gourmandise</i>, as those whose palates
are not gifted with discrimination call the sense of taste, I could
not have hastened with more alacrity to join in the search; but my
disappointment was great, when I found that he was only gathering
old date-stones, which he pounded and then gave, mixed with straw
and water, to his cousin’s cow.</p>

<p>In about four hours, the caravan and my horse, which<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span> had gone to join it, arrived,
and I learned, as I had anticipated, that this fresh delay was due
to my Sheikh, from whom, however, I thought that I was now pretty
safe. But he had still a trick of villany in store for me, for when
the camels came to load (and they carried less weight on account of
the water I should require during the first days), his people
refused to carry water unless I paid half a dollar a skin extra. I
had no resource, as I was still too near Jalo to force them to move
on against their will, but to submit, which I did with secret vows
to have them punished in Siwah for the imposition. I little guessed
what would be my reception there.</p>

<p>It was twelve when I started from the Wadi after filling a dozen
skins at its well, whose water is “sweet as those of heaven,” as
Abd-er-rahman poetically called rain, though the sand from which it
springs is mixed with crystals of common salt, admirably white and
pure. For an hour and a half the ground is dotted thickly with
hillocks of the Tumaran, of which each camel received a bundle in
passing, as during some days little or no wood is to be found on
the road. This is a low-growing woody plant with spare short fleshy
leaves, whose thick twisted roots creep over the sand near its
surface, forming low mounds. It is thornless, is easily torn up in
large pieces, and though alive and in leaf, burns with a clear
bright flame.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span> Much
of the petrified wood found in parts of the desert is formed of
Tumeran, which even in its living state seems to be undergoing the
process of petrifaction, as long veins of red brown earth run
through its roots. Six hours after starting, travelling through
fine loose sand in a N.E. direction, we reached a lofty sand-hill,
the ground at whose base is sprinkled for a considerable distance
with dark gravel and fragments of black half-vitrified stone. Many
parts of this desert, seen in a bright sun, seemed perfectly flat,
but as day closed in, and the shadows lengthened, the gentle
undulations of the sand became visible. For ten hours we continued
our course over a nearly flat country, gradually trending to the
north, when we came to a long line of low hills, among which we
were soon engaged. It is here that the two roads to Siwah separate;
that which I took is the longer, but is easier for the camels; the
other is the one more usually followed by the slave-dealers, and
the same followed by Hornemann; it is preferred as being further
removed from the haunts of the Aoulad Ali Arabs.</p>

<p>In gentle swells, these hills ultimately reach a considerable
height. Journeying over such ground is singularly fatiguing, for
the sand offers no variety to the eye, which is pained by the
intense glare which it reflects, and the horse sinks in it to the
fetlocks at every step. Nothing marked the road, which is
very<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span> rarely used,
and a slight wind suffices to obliterate every trace of former
travellers. No caravan had passed this way to Mecca for three
years, in consequence of disturbances among the Tuarick, to whom
this country principally belongs. Thus we continued during fifteen
hours and a quarter, constantly ascending between two lines of low
hills, which rose on either side like waves driven from opposite
directions. By this I mean that they rise on one side in long
gentle swells and fall very suddenly on the other, forming an angle
of about 70°, while eight or ten feet of their crests are on this,
one would say the lee side, perfectly perpendicular. But the action
of the wind, to which this appearance is doubtless due, is such,
that in this place the lee side of each sand-wave faces that of the
other, forming a valley between them, bounded on each side by steep
sand. My greyhounds enjoyed themselves famously in running along
the crests of these hills, and then rolling and tumbling down their
steep sides; but after a couple of days of such gambols, the sand
began to distress their feet, and they were glad to mount a camel
during the greater part of the remaining journey.</p>

<p>It was on the afternoon of the third day, that, sending on the
servant who had waited on me at luncheon, I stayed behind to smoke
a chibouque, and having a supply of tobacco beside me I
thoughtlessly protracted<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_226">[226]</span> this amusement beyond a due time. When I at
last started I rode straight for the passage, between some distant
hills, where I had last seen the caravan, but soon I found that I
had lost the track. At the height I had then reached, the wind blew
so strongly, that, in exposed places, the footsteps were speedily
effaced, and for an hour I wandered sufficiently to convince me how
easy it would be to lose oneself in the sand. Evening was not far
distant, and I was on the point of returning to my noon-day
resting-place, but determined first to try one cast more. With this
intent I rode directly at right angles to my course, and happily
came upon the tracks of the camels. I soon reached the base of a
peak round which they had gone, and, turning it, I beheld the most
extraordinary scene of desolation.</p>

<p>I found myself standing on the ledge of an oval basin, some five
or six miles long, whose sides were formed of stratified rocks, of
a bluish gray colour, in their horizontal layers; across ran low
dykes of the same laminar construction, the upper layers being
generally of a blackish stone, but all bearing the appearance of
vitrifaction. The dykes ran in lines parallel to the minor axis of
the ellipse, and one might almost have supposed it the ruins of a
construction on a gigantic scale, like that called Solomon’s Pool,
near Bethlehem. Excepting at points where the rocks
crop<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span> out, the
bottom of the basin was filled with sand; piles of stones,
memorials of former caravans, erected on the dykes; many skeletons,
both of men and camels, bleached white as the purest ivory, pointed
out the path which I must follow. Night closed in while I was still
in this lonely valley; and it was with some pleasure that I heard
the signal guns, which were fired from time to time, to direct me
to the halting place. At sunset, as I had not been seen for six
hours, the caravan was halted, although it had only made ten hours
and a half journey that day. The Arabs call this place the
Gerdobiah, or Little Gerdebah, <span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">قردبه</span>, to distinguish it from the great range of this
name, which commences two hours and a half further on. A ridge of
round-backed sandhills forms the separation between the Gerdobiah
and the immense range of low dark hills and table-lands which here
presents itself. A low line of sandstone rocks, with nearly
perpendicular sides, bound the line of road, sometimes closing upon
it, sometimes leaving a wide plain on either side. In the basins
thus formed rocks rise frequently, in the form of low truncated
cones, generally in two steps, one rising from the other, so like
diminutive craters, that in referring to this day’s journey my
servant always calls them, “<i>les Vesuves</i>.” The black
appearance of the ground is caused by numberless fragments of flat,
dark, flint-like, coarse, broken glass, with which<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span> the sand and rocks are
covered; among them are many pieces of petrified palm-wood; and, in
some places, I found four or five feet of the trunk of the tree
still standing erect as it grew: while, in more than one instance,
large fragments of the tree, like the <i>débris</i> of a broken
column, lay scattered round. In one spot, I found the trunk of such
a tree (judging from its form at the base) in the position and
place where it grew, and lying alongside of it, fragments of its
stem, in all more than twenty feet long; the fractures of each of
these corresponded to those on either side of it. It would seem
from this that the trees were petrified as they grew, and that
their general prostration is due to some convulsion which followed
the withdrawal of the petrifying waters in which they had been
immersed. I believe these trees to be, many of them, date palms,
such as grow in the oases at the present day; they are similar in
appearance; and so were some petrified date-stones, which I found,
to their stones. It took in all twenty-six hours to traverse this
line, which, judging from the cold, must be at a very considerable
elevation. The south wind blew so bleakly that even at midday a
cloak was a welcome addition to the borneau. In the mornings and
evenings the thermometer was rarely above 43°, and at midday,
notwithstanding the bright sun, I twice found it only 45°.</p>

<p>Towards the last part of the Gerdebah I observed<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span> large masses of
beautifully-marked agate, of a coarse crystalline grain, with
colours more vivid than the Sicilian. Descending into a plain of
sand, the next landmark is a lofty cone, called Gar Hhot,
<span class="arabic" lang="ar">خوت</span>, some sixty or seventy
feet high, which rising abruptly from the level, is seen at a great
distance. It was formerly a stronghold of the Aoulad Ali, who from
it descended to pillage the Majabra caravans. The tombs of seven or
eight Majabra, who were killed in one of their raids some forty
years ago, are at the base of the hill; but this was the robbers’
last exploit, for the Majabra are said to have come in overwhelming
numbers, and to have overpowered them. I will not answer for the
truth of the story which was told me by my guide, whose grandfather
was among the slain; for in my experience of timid people, I must
do the Majabra of the present generation the justice to say, that I
never met with any who had so strong a regard for their personal
safety. Along this line they never light fires during the night,
for fear of attracting the Arabs, and for the same reason they
frequently diverge from the direct line of journey; their cargoes
of human merchandise being, it is said, very attractive to the
Arabs. However this may be, I have no complaint to make of the
dangers of the road: every night two large fires were kindled in my
encampment, yet I was never molested, nor during the whole journey
saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span> trace of
man, excepting in the case of one small slave caravan, which I came
up with the day after passing Gar Hhot, at the first well we
reached, called Maten Et-Tarfawy, <span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">طرفاوي</span>. It is seventy-four hours from the well of the
Wady.</p>

<p>This place was visited by Hornemann, and is the only spot in
which my route (which is the one followed by the great pilgrim
caravans) coincides with the more southerly one. The slave caravan,
which I came up with here, continued to follow Hornemann’s route.
Near the place I found some palm trunks upright, imbedded in
reddish, coarsely crystallised flint. The sand is in great part
composed of <i>débris</i> of small marine shells, and the limestone
rocks from here to Siwah are filled with fossils. A considerable
descent from the high ground we had been traversing, crossing
several hills and valleys, which grow gradually more sandy as we
advanced, leads to a valley clothed with gum bushes. From it rises
a platform of soft, white limestone rock; and it is in this that
the wells of brackish water called Et-Tarfawy are pierced. The
white platform is picturesquely crowned with a garland of the
bright-green ’ajrum bushes, which grow somewhat like a broom. Here
we watered our camels, and then went an hour and a half further to
a hattych (a copse) called Bou el Lawah, <span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">لاوه</span>. The wind, which had blown for several days
constantly from the south,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_231">[231]</span> shifted for a few hours to the north, and
was gratefully warm; heavy rains speedily followed, during which it
again veered to the south.</p>

<p>From here to Siwah I was six days on the road, but one day I was
only able to travel five hours; in fact, I never again got a fair
day’s work out of my camels, for Sheikh Othman, after making me pay
so dearly for them, sent them with so small a supply of food, that
they successively dropped off, one after another, exhausted from
sheer hunger. I cannot, therefore, state the distance exactly, but
as nearly as I can calculate, from Et-Tarfawy to Siwah is
forty-eight hours. The road runs through a succession of small
oases, of which the first is Faredrah, <span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">فغيدره</span>, twelve hours from Et-Tarfawy. Among sandhills
one descends very suddenly into a long basin, which is occupied by
a dark brown morass, like that which I met with at Augila; it is
bounded on three sides by time-worn rocks, which rise
perpendicularly round it, a fringe of palm trees growing about
their base. The Arabs pointed out a place in the rocks, on the
other side of the morass, in which they said the ruins of a castle
were to be seen. Now this, like the other spots of the same nature
which I passed through, is uninhabited. The largest and prettiest
of these is Caicab, twelve hours further on. Here the rocks of
variegated limestone assume a bolder appearance, rising from forty
to a hundred feet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
in fantastic masses, looking in the distance sometimes like noble
cities, sometimes like extensive ruins. There is one valley where
columns, with their capitals of gigantic proportions, rise from
mounds of sand—half buried palaces and temples seemed in the
moonlight to make the former the abode of giants. From the uniform
abruptness of the sides of the rocks, though weather-worn and
varied in colour by the different strata, it would seem that these
morasses had been formed by a suddenly falling in of the crust; for
the flat tops of all the surrounding rocks have the same level with
the desert and with each other, and the wall of rock is only found
on the side turned to the morass. In a Wady some twelve hours
further on I found wells of a clear water, in very small quantity,
but which, after the first draught had been taken from it, filled
again by rapid infiltration from the sand, but this second supply
had a strong sulphurous smell and taste, which were not perceptible
in the first. The morass, the universal feature of these oases, was
here a wide lake of a deep blue, inclosed in a ring of brown crust,
overgrown with rushes, and a tall, rank grass, of which the camels
eagerly plucked the flowering tops. The name of this place is El
Ghazalieh, the Gazelle Ground, and though now deserted, it must in
ancient times have been inhabited. Sepulchral chambers, entirely
devoid of ornament, but well and regularly cut, are<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span> hollowed out in the faces of
the rocks. Each opening, of about four feet square, corresponds to
a cubical aperture of seven feet, in two sides of which—in that
facing the door, and in that generally to the left—are cut
receptacles for the dead. I counted twenty-three; but there may be
many more, which, being sanded up, escaped my observation. Most of
them are as empty as if they had never been occupied; but in some
of these deserted abodes of death the wild bee has stored her
sweets. We made a long halt in this place, for the camels had to be
watered, and I had to dress as well as to breakfast, for the guide
having lost his way, we had gone supperless to bed, being
unprovided with either wood or water. This had twice occurred to
me, and each time I had promised myself never again to be without
at least one skin of water; but though my orders were no doubt
attended to during the first few days, it always happened that,
when the precaution would have proved useful, it had been
neglected. In my luggage I had wherewithal to supply every
deficiency but this; and the want of this, however little I care
for the pure fluid, is fatal to all hopes of supping.</p>

<p>This was the last day before reaching Siwah; and, again, I was
sadly delayed through the miserable condition of the camels
supplied by my rascally sheikh of Augila. One after another they
dropped, unable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span> to
proceed, and I was obliged to leave them, and the boxes they
carried, in the sand. Unable to get further, we slept on a hill, at
whose foot I beheld next morning a garden-like expanse—a real
island of the blest. A stream, the first running water I had seen
since quitting the Rhone, flowed down its centre; the ground on
either side was green with young crops, among which rose clumps of
date-trees and flowering mimosas. Some cabins dotted the extensive
plain, and men and children were busily employed in irrigating the
fields; the very water, perfectly sweet, after the thirst-exciting
draughts to which we had been for some time condemned, seemed
delicious; and, perhaps, by contrast with the barren sand we had so
tediously journeyed through, this valley, towards Moragah,
<span class="arabic" lang="ar">مراقه</span>, seemed one of the
loveliest spots I had ever visited. I welcomed the exhilarating
impression which it made upon me, as a foretaste of the enjoyment
reserved for me in Siwah, from which we were now only six hours
distant, and I began to believe my Majabra guide might not be wrong
in his daily assurances that it was a Belad Mabruk, an abode of
blessedness.</p>

<p>After leaving Moragah, the loose sand again reappears for about
an hour, leading to the lofty rocks of Kamisah, at whose base are
the ruins called ’Amu-dein, which consist of two lofty masses of
brick<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span> work, the
façade of a temple, or perhaps of a church, for the style of
building betrays a late date. One of the two salt lakes of the
oasis lies at the foot of Kamisah, and I stopped for an hour at a
well of sweet water which springs at its edge, to rest the last of
Othman’s camels, which here threatened to drop. The hill of the
mummies, Garah-el-Musabberin, and the village of Gharmy, where the
principal ruins are, were visible from here, as well as the
position, though not the town, of Siwah. I sent on the camels,
retaining only one servant with me; soon following them, I found
that one of the camels had again lagged behind the others. I
therefore stopped, and spreading a carpet in the shade of a tree, I
sat down, having first sent a servant into the town to Sheikh
Yusuf, whom my slave-dealer acquaintance had named to me as the
chief man of the place, to obtain donkeys to transport the luggage
of the camel. Here I sat alone for two hours, until the sun had
set, and began at length to reflect on the uncertainty of Arab
accounts of distances; the town might still be two or three hours
off, and with a strong determination to dine to-night, having been
on short commons for the last four days, I left the camel where it
was, and rode towards the town. Night closed in before I had come
upon any well-marked path, and I was beginning to feel
some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span> perplexity as
to the road, when I luckily came upon the servant I had dispatched
to Yusuf’s, and one of the men who accompanied him turned to guide
me to my tent, while he went back to bring up the remainder of the
luggage.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">It</span> was soon perfectly
night; the ground seemed to be cut up with ditches, and it was only
by keeping close to my guide, as he trotted along on his donkey,
that I could make out the road. After about half an hour, the guide
jumping off his donkey, said to me, “Now you are going up hill,”
and before I knew what I was doing, unable to see an inch before me
in the darkness, I found my horse clambering up what seemed to be
the face of a precipice; in about five minutes more, I found myself
riding among walls; presently, my guide stopping, began to call
out, “Yusuf! Yusuf!” and thus I found that instead of taking me to
my tent, he had brought me to the sheikh’s. After some delay a door
was opened; and a longer time elapsed before a flaring palm-branch
was brought to light me;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_238">[238]</span> and then I was conducted, through all sorts
of tortuous passages to a small room, where the sheikh and two
young men were seated on mats, before a blazing fire of olive wood.
He received me very cordially, told me that my tents were ready,
and that whatever I required I should get through him. I thanked
him and accepted his offers, giving him at the same time to
understand, that I would take nothing as a present, and that all I
required should be paid for. He said that the servant I had sent to
him had already told him this.</p>

<p>These preliminaries being settled, there was a pause, which he
broke after looking steadily at my head for some time, by saying,
“Where’s your hat?” I thought I had misunderstood, and begged he
would favour me by repeating his remark. He gravely reiterated,
“Where’s your hat?” After the hearty fit of laughter which so droll
a question as this seemed to me produced, I told him that, for the
moment, I did not keep such an elegant luxury in my establishment;
but this seemed to puzzle him sorely, for a hat was evidently, in
his eyes, one of the chief articles of the Christian faith. “Have
you brandy, wine, rosolio, tea?” I began to think that he was
making a mental inventory of the good things he meant to ask for,
though I afterwards found it was mere curiosity to find out whether
I was as abundantly supplied with<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_239">[239]</span> these good things, as were my last
predecessors at Siwah.</p>

<p>This cross-examination began to tire me, so I took leave of him;
but before I retired he invited me to return in the morning,
promising then to provide me with a guide to see all the
curiosities of Siwah. I promised to come early, but explained that
by early I did not mean early as he understood it, for, when not
travelling, I do not rise till two hours after the sun. “Oh!” he
answered, “drunk with araki;” meaning, that I lay in bed to sleep
off the effects of the intemperance he gave me credit for; when I
assured him that I had never in my life been drunk. “Do you, then,
never drink wine or araki?” seemed to be the only solution for the
wonder which his experience could suggest. We parted very good
friends, and I proceeded to my tent. The night was still too dark
for anything but the fires to be visible, and it was only the next
morning that I obtained an idea of our position.</p>

<p>I was encamped on a very wide plain to the south of the town; to
the right was an extensive palm grove with a few clumps in front of
the principal plantation, the nearest about a hundred yards off;
behind and to the left rose some limestone rocks, and near them a
square building, the castle, in which a garrison was formerly
lodged. In front, the town rose like a lofty<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_240">[240]</span> fortress, built on a conical rock,
entirely concealed by the houses, which, joining one another, seem
to form a single many-storied edifice. To the west of this, another
rock or gara, quarried with numerous caverns, rises to a
considerable height; on one side of the rock, and in the space
between it and the town proper, houses, in the ordinary style of
mud architecture, are built.</p>

<p>It was here that Yusuf’s house, the largest in the place, was
built, leaning against the hill, and I now proceeded there to
obtain the guide he had promised me. I was received in a room open
to the street, in which a large crowd was assembled. Yusuf
immediately began, in a tone very different to that of the
preceding evening, to tell me the old story: that the people did
not choose that I should enter their town, or see their wells,
which my incantations might dry up, and that they insisted upon my
immediate departure. In the room, seated round the walls, were
several stupid-looking men, who, he told me, were the sheikhs of
the place, over whom he had no authority—his influence being
confined to that part of the rock which he inhabited, since his
deposition some years before. He tried hard to render the decision
of the town council (the Mejlis) palatable to me by frequent
assurances, that the Siwyah have no sense. “No sense! no sense!” he
shouted into my ears, as if I had<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_241">[241]</span> been deaf. “They must learn sense, or buy
it,” was my answer, “for since I am come here, you cannot treat me
in this way; it is contrary to the rights of hospitality and the
laws of your country. I am an Englishman. There is my passport, the
English sultan’s firman, better than ’Abd el Mejid’s or any other
in the world, more respected by Abbas Pacha and ’Abd el Mejid
himself than their own. I ask to enter no man’s house. I shall not
run away with your wives, nor eat your children; but I have a right
to go by every public path; to see all I want to see of the old
ruins in your country; and if you, the sheikhs, prevent me, you
must be prepared to take the consequences; and if any one insults
or molests me, he has only himself to blame for what may happen to
him.”</p>

<p>I had gone unarmed, but I now sent down to my tent for a pair of
revolvers, and after making Yusuf admire their construction, I had
them placed in the holsters of my saddle. “You ask me what is my
business here? I am a traveller from the west going to Cairo,
through the Sultan’s and Pacha’s dominions; you are their subjects.
Your own laws, the laws of Islam, give me full right to travel in
your country; the treaties with the Sultan guarantee me protection;
you are responsible to the Pacha, and he must answer to my country
for anything that befals me here.” I now mounted my horse and was
riding away, when the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_242">[242]</span> Mufti arrived, and I returned, at Yusuf’s
earnest request, to explain myself to him. He was an irresolute,
shuffling old man, apparently afraid to speak above a whisper, but
unable to deny the truth of what I said. Yusuf then returned to the
charge with shouts of “No sense! no sense!” in which he was joined
by all the sheikhs, who pretended to lament the ignorance and
stupidity of their rayahs, while the Mufti seemed very anxious to
get me into a religious discussion, which I was not foolish enough
to engage in. By this time the room was pretty full, all the great
men of the place, excepting two of the sheikhs and the Cadi, who
had refused to pollute their eyes with the sight of the Christian,
being assembled there. The street also in front was crowded with
the curious, who stared as if they never could see enough of me;
but they did not interrupt the discussion.</p>

<p>Seeing that the plea of stupidity did not turn me from my point,
they now changed their tone; and one of them, whose insolent air
had from the first been very offensive, gave me to understand that
I could not be allowed to defile their blessed country with my
presence, and that the best thing I could do would be to return
quietly to my tent, shut myself up there, and get camels as quickly
as possible to pursue my journey. “Four hawajahs came here from
Alexandria some years ago, we fired upon them, after
forbidding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span> our
people to have any intercourse with them, and they went away next
morning, vowing vengeance indeed, but nothing came of it.” “I am
not a hawajah, and I do not mean to run away;” then, turning to the
Mufti, I added, “nor will there, I am sure, be any reason for me to
do so. I only want to see the old ruins of your country, and then,
without having done injury to any one, I shall pursue my journey.”
So we bandied about the same arguments for at least three hours,
when at last it was agreed that before going to Omen Beydah I
should wait till midday next day to give them time to persuade
their people not to molest me; and that my time might not be lost,
Yusuf was to send me in the morning a man to accompany me to a hot
well near the high hill, which lies to the south of the town. I had
now no doubt that I had carried my point, and returned to dine in
great spirits, persuaded that I had vanquished the opposition,
trusting to the well-known timidity and gentleness of the Egyptian
Fellah, and the activity Mehemet Ali had always displayed in
punishing violence offered to travellers. I found my cook, a black,
whom I had brought with me from Dernah, in a terrible fright, for
some of the people had told him, when he went into the town to buy
some provisions, that they were coming to rob me during the night.
I laughed at his fears, quoting to him the saying, ‘Forewarned,
forearmed.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>After dinner, I
was smoking my chibouque and marking in my note-book the little I
had observed or heard during the day, when three shots were fired,
the balls passing with a loud whistling through my tent just over
my head. At first I thought little of the incident, believing that
it was a rough joke meant to frighten me; so I merely looked at my
watch and noted the circumstance in my note-book. It was perfectly
dark, and from the door of my tent nothing was visible, nor should
I have thought more of it but for the violent barking of my dog,
which showed that it heard people, who were invisible to me. I sent
a servant, therefore, to Yusuf’s to acquaint him with what had
passed, and soon after he was gone, the firing recommenced. I now
began to think the affair more serious than I had supposed; I heard
one gun hang fire close to my tent, and, turning, saw its muzzle
pressed against the wall of the tent on the shadow of my head; I
therefore had all the lights put out, and went cautiously out to
get a view of my assailants. The night was so black that this was
impossible, but it also favoured my evasion; after counting eleven
volleys, which gave me grounds to suspect that there was a numerous
body of men in the date-trees to the right, I, with my servant,
went up to the sheikh Yusuf’s house, abandoning the tents to their
fate. Moving cautiously across the plain, which separated us
from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span> the town, and
climbing the steep street which led to his house, we could still
see the fire of the enemy’s guns, and the more frequent flashes in
the pan, to which we probably owed our escape.</p>

<p>The servant whom I had sent there had returned, saying that he
could not make himself heard at Yusuf’s, but when we reached the
door a vigorous application of the butt-end of my rifle roused him;
having admitted me, I told him what had happened, adding, that I
should stay with him till morning. He immediately sent some of his
people to protect the tents, which they found had not been entered,
though there were seven shots in the one in which I had passed the
day, and one shot had passed immediately over the place where I was
reclining when the attack commenced; had I been sitting up instead
of lounging, it could not have missed me. By one of those strange
chances which one feels to be providential, I had just after sunset
ordered a larger tent to be pitched, in which to dine and sleep; I
had been all the morning in a small umbrella one, at which the
shots were principally aimed, and to this circumstance must my
escape be ascribed.</p>

<p>I spent the night in Yusuf’s house, and the next day he gave me
a small one, containing three rooms, opposite his own, in which to
stay as long as might<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_246">[246]</span> be necessary. One of these rooms was built
on the roof, with a sort of terrace before it; we were standing
upon this, after viewing my intended abode, when our attention was
attracted to a large body of, perhaps, four or five hundred men,
most of them armed, who were in march with a flag, and several
camels against my tents. The rumour had been spread in the town
that the Christian was not dead, and the entire male population of
the Lifayah had gone against him, with camels to carry off the
spoil. They found the tents closed, and no appearance of any one
near them, but they thought I and my Frank servant were inside. It
was long before they ventured to approach, for the camel men, who
had come with me from Augila, had given a wonderful description of
the number and power of my arms; at last, some bolder than the
rest, went up and tore aside the curtain of the umbrella tent in
which I was supposed to be. Meanwhile, Yusuf had sent for some of
the sheikhs, and assuring them that anything stolen would have to
be replaced ten-fold by the town, he induced them to go to the
rescue of my baggage. This they succeeded in effecting, and
returned in a few hours to tell me that everything was safe, and to
ask for a certificate to that effect. I refused to take their word
for it, and at their urgent solicitation, accompanied by them,
I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span> rode down to the
plain, which was now quite solitary. Everything was in strange
confusion, but nothing had been taken away.</p>

<p>Seeing the turn things had taken, I now determined to continue
my journey at once, promising myself to return to Siwah with an
escort from the Viceroy, as soon as I should arrive in Egypt. But
if the Sewiyah had given me so warm a reception, they had no wish
to lose the advantage of my company; and, therefore, by threats
prevented any of the Arabs, of whom great numbers were now in
Siwah, from hiring me camels. I then proposed to Yusuf to leave my
baggage in his charge, if he would procure me a sufficient number
of donkeys to mount my servants, and carry a few skins of water and
provisions; but he declared that, without camels, it was impossible
to cross the desert, and that if I attempted to get away at the
present moment, the people would follow and massacre my servants
and myself on the road. I waited, therefore, a day or two to see
what would turn up, nothing doubting that rather than keep the
Christian in their town, these zealous Moslemin would in a day or
two come to terms. In fact, on the third day of my imprisonment,
three of the sheikhs came and offered me camels to go away with,
but just before this the Mufti had sent privately to warn me, that
if I accepted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
offer, my caravan would be waylaid a few hours out of the
oasis.</p>

<p>I now wrote to Her Majesty’s Consul-General in Cairo,
acquainting him with the position I was in, and requesting
assistance, and Yusuf dispatched my letter by one of his slaves,
who was familiar with the country he had to traverse. I had
previously endeavoured to persuade a Bedawy to be my messenger, but
after bargaining for an exorbitant remuneration, he lost courage
and refused to take it. When, however, on the second day
afterwards, he missed the slave, he did not doubt I had sent him to
Cairo; and now, regretting the money he might have gained, he
revenged himself by telling the people that I had sent to bring
soldiers. On this the Mejlis assembled to deliberate; their first
proceeding was to come to Yusuf, to ask if it were true that I had
written to his Highness. He answered that he could tell them
nothing about it, and that they had better apply to me. The three
who had rescued the baggage, now, therefore, presented themselves,
and at Yusuf’s request I admitted them. In answer to their
questions I said that I was no way bound to satisfy their
curiosity, but that being a good-natured fellow, and my messenger
by this time a long way on his road, I consented to gratify them. I
had, indeed, written to tell how I had<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_249">[249]</span> been attacked, and how I was imprisoned by
them in Sheikh Yusuf’s house, and that I had added, I should now
stay there till an answer was sent to me.</p>

<p>For the first fortnight that I was shut up in the cabin Yusuf
had given me, though unable to stir out, I found the time passed
quickly enough, as, besides that Yusuf and the people of his clan
came often to see me (so that my house was generally full), there
was every day something exciting, which afforded amusement. One
evening, for instance, some shots were fired into my house,
probably by way of keeping me on the <i>qui vive</i> rather than
with any murderous intention; another day, the whole of the Lifayah
assembled in arms, at the small village called the Manshieh,
determined at night to march upon my house, and so end the matter.
They were resolved to get rid of the Christian; and to encourage
themselves in their warlike resolutions, many of them bound
themselves “by the divorce,” to exterminate him, and the big
war-drum was put out into the sun to stretch the skin, and give it
a terror-inspiring tone. Next, a deputation of the sheikhs came to
me to offer peace and friendship, if I would only go away and tell
the Pacha that I had nothing to complain of. I explained to them
with infinite suavity, that this was out of the question. How could
I say that I had nothing to complain of? beside this, my letter
must be already<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span> in
Cairo, and having said in it that I should wait for an answer, I
could not, of course, go away till it came. I also reminded them of
their own frequent protestations, that they had no authority over
the people, and asked what security they could offer me that I
should not be attacked, as once intended, on the journey.
Negotiation proving ineffectual, they tried a new dodge. Yusuf was
cited before the Mejlis to answer for harbouring a Christian, and
men were posted in the narrow dark streets of the town to kill him
as he went, but the Mufti again sent him warning of the plot, which
Yusuf the more readily gave credence to, as his father had been
killed in this way.</p>

<p>Then again a fresh attack with arms was planned for the evening,
and this seemed so menacing that Yusuf put garrisons into the
largest houses in my neighbourhood, and came himself, with ten men,
to aid in defending mine. I was luckily well provided with arms,
and disposed everything to make what would probably have been a
successful resistance. At the advice of one of the principal men of
the place, and to prevent the chance of firing on our own friends
in the dark, the garrison was withdrawn from the surrounding
houses; their presence there, in case of a <i>melée</i>, would, I
confess, have been more alarming to me than the attack from below,
and being marched to the foot of the Garah, with much screaming but
fortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span> no
bloodshed, they repulsed the Lifayah, who turned backwards when
they found preparations made to receive them. After this night
there was a regular patrol established in this part of the
town.</p>

<p>One evening, just before sunset, when seated with Yusuf on the
roof of my dwelling, four men, with guns, were seen on the rock
which overhangs the house. They were observed just as they were
creeping round a corner, by a servant who was bringing a chibouque,
our backs being turned to them; a cry was immediately raised,
people were dispatched to arrest them, and two were secured, the
others escaping. Yusuf had no power to do anything with them, he
being, in fact, as much a prisoner as myself; and was fain to
accept their explanation, that they had come to shoot crows, in
order to obtain their galls, with which to anoint the eyes of some
one who had an ophthalmia.</p>

<p>Other trivial annoyances, many of them so childish as to be
merely amusing, were with great ingenuity resorted to. The little
children used to assemble round my house, calling out, “Oh, Consul,
there is no God but God!” and singing songs which I suspect were
not altogether complimentary. Nosrani and Consul were the names I
was known by among the people when they spoke of me to one another.
I had declined the latter title, to which I had no
pretension;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span> and
would not be called Hawadjah, which is the polite name generally
given to Franks in Egypt, even by the Government, in its
correspondence with the foreign Consuls, and which means a small
trader or pedlar; Yusuf, therefore, gave me the title of El Senhor,
which I have retained to this day. The people were forbidden to
sell me anything, and it was with no small difficulty that Yusuf
procured for me the very meagre fare with which I was fain to be
satisfied; a couple of tame fowls, some rice or lentils, butter and
dates, were the provision for four persons; and this scanty supply
cost, on an average, more than a guinea a-day. One of the wealthier
people sold me a goose one day, for which he was cited before the
Mejlis, and beaten, though his brother was one of the sheikhs.</p>

<p>Time wore on, and the twentieth day, on which I expected an
answer to my letter would arrive, had come and gone. Some Arabs
from the west brought a report that the Viceroy had been murdered,
and some of the sheikhs did not fail to come to me the next day to
see how I took the news. Of course, I made light of it, telling
them that if Abbas were dead, Said would be Viceroy, and that the
English Government, which does not die, would take as good care of
me under the one as under the other. When, however, a second report
to the same effect arrived, a few<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_253">[253]</span> days afterwards, I acknowledge that I felt
less unconcern than I cared to show, for such an event, if true,
would have probably prolonged my detention, if it did not endanger
my life and that of my protector Yusuf, and my servants.</p>

<p>The time which I had calculated would bring an answer to my
letters (for I had found means to send a second letter on the
chance of the first having miscarried) had long past; and I had no
easy task to keep Yusuf and his friends in good spirits. They were
becoming very uneasy, for they had committed themselves both to the
Egyptian government and the Sewiyah; the first would render them
responsible for my safety, the second would never forgive the
protection afforded to the Christian. At length, one day, a hot
south wind arose, and blew with great violence during that and the
three following days; hereon a hundred and forty of the men, who
felt themselves most guilty, left Siwah for the Arab encampments on
the Okbah; for now they believed, most of them for the first time,
that something would come of my complaint, as a hot south wind in
Siwah, such as this, is regarded by them as the unfailing signal of
some coming calamity. One is almost tempted to think they must be a
remnant of the Psylli, who had escaped the general destruction of
their nation, and still dread their old enemy. Yusuf’s adjurations
and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span> threats had had
no effect in persuading them that they would rue their inhospitable
conduct to a stranger, but this day of hot wind convinced them that
what he said was true.</p>

<p>From this time forward there were constant applications from the
sheikhs and principal people of the Lifayah, to see the Nosrani;
and those whom I admitted, came to protest that they had taken no
part in anything that had befallen me, charitably throwing the
blame on the others. Each, in fact, was the only innocent man in
the place; and all felt the tenderest affection for my person. Such
evidences of esteem and consideration were, of course, most
gratifying to my feelings, and made me the more regret that they
had put it out of my power to be serviceable to them; having
applied to the English Consul-General, and he, of course, to the
Viceroy, any decision in the matter now depended, not on me, but on
them.</p>

<p>Such scenes were not, however, my only amusements. During the
day I picked up some scraps of information about the manners and
superstitions of the country from my various visitors. From a
Fezyan Fikhi I got some quaint lessons in theological lore; and
from a Moghrabi treasure-seeker I heard a good deal of the
excavations which he had at different times made, not, however, to
seek the antiquities which he seems to have found, but the hidden
wealth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span> which,
judging from his appearance, I should say had escaped him. Every
evening after dinner, Sheikh Yusuf and a dozen of his friends used
to come, and sit with me for two or three hours. Their favourite
conversation turned upon the wickedness of the Lifayah, whom they
seemed to regard as the greatest monsters in the world; my guests
would tell how they had beaten their last governor, and killed
Yusuf’s father, and how they fired upon travellers. Then they would
expatiate with monkey-like chuckling on the exasperation which
their conduct would produce in the Pacha; what he would do to this
one, what to that—all subjects which my friends wore threadbare,
without ever seeming to tire of them. Sometimes the entertainment
was varied by stories which Yusuf told with great native humour; or
we killed time and tried to satisfy our impatience by practising
the method of divination called Derb-er-raml.</p>

<p>The stories I will spare the reader, who has had enough of Arab
tales in every shape, though I am sadly tempted to tell how the two
little donkeys were welded into a big one, or how the ass stuck in
the mud, and the hyæna ate him, notwithstanding his long horns.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of Siwah speak a dialect of the Berbery, and
only a very few of them know any word<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_256">[256]</span> of Arabic; they are unquestionably an
Aboriginal people, probably the descendants of one of the Nomad
tribes, who inhabited the interior of Libya, and who may have
succeeded to the possession of the Oasis of Ammon, after the
extinction of the Roman power in this country. The entire
population consists of the inhabitants of Siwah Proper, which is
divided into east and west, and those of Agharmy, a small town
about two miles to the east, in all little more than four thousand
souls. The inhabitants of the eastern part of the town, my enemies,
are called Sharkyin, or Lifayah, and these are again subdivided
into three clans. The Westerns or Gharbyin are, in the same way,
composed of three clans, and each clan has two sheikhs; these, with
the Mufti and Cadi, form the Mejlis, presided over until his
deposition by Yusuf as Sheikh-el-Beled. Their own account of their
origin is, that, excepting three families of the old race, whose
genealogy goes back to the remotest times, the whole of them are
Arabs, Moghrabin, or Fellahs; none of whom have been settled here
for more than four generations. Judging from their features, I
should think that there must be a much greater mixture of the blood
of an older race; nor is it likely, if Arabic had been the original
language of the immense majority, that it should be now only known
to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span> so few persons,
after this short lapse of time. Of the women there is hardly one
who understands anything but the Siwy Berbery.</p>

<p>They are a singularly ugly race, with dark-brown complexion, and
a truly bestial expression, but with no trace of the negro type,
while they are still further removed from the Arab and Copt. Their
fierce disposition makes them dreaded by the Arabs, who come to
Siwah to buy dates, and who are subjected during their stay there
to a most rigorous police. Those of the women whom I saw through my
telescope on the roofs of the houses, were not more agreeable in
appearance than the men; and even childhood is here devoid of the
engaging graces of its age.</p>

<p>The dress of the men is a long shirt with drawers; a skull-cap
of cotton, to which a milaya, such as is worn by the Egyptian
women, is added. The head-dress of the women is curious. The front
hair is plaited into twelve small braids, which hang straight over
the forehead; on each side is a similar short bunch, looking like
nothing but the cords of a mop, and round the head are wound two
long plaits brought from behind. Over this the milaya is thrown,
and a dark blue shirt completes the costume. They are kept very
strictly confined to the house, which the wealthier never leave,
and no respectable woman goes<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_258">[258]</span> out excepting at night. These precautions
of the Siwy are said to be as efficacious as those of the Djin, who
kept his lady-love in a box; and the moral character of the Siwah
fair is such, that had he reigned here, Pheron would probably never
have recovered his eye-sight.</p>

<p>The men are notoriously bad, at the same time that they are
among the most fanatical Moslemin in Africa. In fact, I had good
reason to believe correct what was said to me of them:—“Every vice
and every indulgence is lawful (Hellal) to the Siwy. Nothing is
forbidden to them (Haram), but the presence of a Christian.” They
are divided into two schools, the followers of the Sunūsy, of whom
I shall have to speak later, and the Dirkawy, the ranters of Islam,
who derive their origin from a celebrated sheikh of Masrata, who
died a hundred years ago. Between the two orders the same affection
seems to exist as fable attributes to the Jesuits and Dominicans in
Christendom.</p>

<p>The Siwy are superstitious, though, perhaps, not more so than
the ignorant masses in all countries; nearly all the men have
amulets sewed to their caps, or hung round their necks; every house
is defended from the evil eye by an earthen pot well blackened in
the fire, which is built mouth downwards over the doorway, or at
one corner; and in addition to this charm, it is not uncommon to
see the leg bones of an<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_259">[259]</span> ass projecting from some part of the
building: this struck me particularly, as this use of it was once a
superstitious practice in England. This and similar practices were
forbidden by the Council of London, held about the year 1075.</p>

<p>After saying so much in dispraise of the Siwy, I must add that,
compared with the people of Jalo and Augila, they are an
industrious race, paying great attention to the cultivation of
their palms and olive-trees, which they manure and tend with
infinite care. A great part of the soil is capable of producing
grain, and they possess extensive corn-fields; these being
cultivated entirely with the spade, demand much labour; the
consequence of which is, that the small population is unable to
bring even the near-lying grounds completely under crop. From this
cause several fertile oases dependent on Siwah are now abandoned.
Interspersed among their palm-groves they have abundance of vines,
apricots, and pomegranates, whose sweet though small fruit they
preserve all the winter. To manure their trees they employ a thorny
plant, which grows in great quantities in Maragah, called ’agul.
This they collect and bind into large bundles, three of which form
a donkey load; then, digging pits round the trees, they bury these
bundles in them, after which they water them<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_260">[260]</span> regularly once in six days. All caravans
coming to Siwah are obliged to put up in a particular place, and
the manure thus collected, along with the produce of the ’agul
grounds, is sold every year by auction for the benefit of the
community.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">One</span> of my first visitors
was the Moghrabi from Tangiers, already mentioned, called El
Gibely, who has been settled here for many years. He was a perfect
specimen of this class of adventurers; pretending to have a
familiar spirit, a djin who waits upon him, and tells him the
secrets of futurity. He wrote charms to discover treasures, and to
cure all manner of diseases, and I almost think had ended by
believing in them himself. The day after I was shut up in Yusuf’s
house he took an opportunity of vaunting to me highly the virtues
of his amulets, particularly of one which renders its possessor
ball-proof. He fancied, probably, that this was the moment to
effect a profitable sale, and I asked questions, and listened to
him with a grave attention which must have given him
great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span> hopes. In
this he overrated my credulity; but I repaid his communicativeness
in kind, by describing to him the wonders of the electric
telegraph, which I thought would astonish him; but in this I was in
turn disappointed, as he listened to my accounts of instantaneous
messages sent over land and sea, without expressing a doubt, or
even asking how such wonders were performed. In fact, he already
knew all about it—“It was the djin.”</p>

<p>I one day sent for him to perform the often-talked-of miracle,
or trick of the ink-spot in a child’s hand. A young negro, about
nine years old, was introduced, and the inscription on his forehead
was written with all due ceremony, the seal was drawn in his hand,
the coriander seed was burned under his nose, until the poor
child’s eyes ran with tears, and the fear he was in covered his
forehead with big drops of sweat. After some time he saw a person
in the ink-spot; he was then told to order him to bring another,
whom he was not long in fancying he saw; but he then became quite
wild, and neither the muttered surah, nor the repeated orders of
the Moghrabi had any further effect. The child could see nothing
more. I regarded the experiment with the most incredulous caution;
and, though it certainly failed, I was not convinced that so-called
animal magnetism would not<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_263">[263]</span> give an explanation of the phenomena, such
as trustworthy Arabs have assured me they had themselves seen. Leo
Africanus speaks of these conjurors with the utmost contempt; and,
I believe, all later Europeans who have written on the subject
regard the proceeding as a gross trick; but in these countries it
is universally believed, even by men who laugh at the usual
apparatus of charms and amulets. One of my friends brought me a
manuscript, which he had found among the effects of a moghrabi who
died here many years ago, in which the whole process is explained;
it was essentially the same as that used by El Gibely, who,
probably to enhance the mystery of the proceeding in my eyes,
added, besides the two lines which are written on the forehead, a
sort of star over the nose, and inscriptions on each eyebrow.<a id=
"FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>Having spoken at
such length of the art of making “the Djin descend into a child’s
hand,” I may complete my confession of the black arts which I
learned here, by describing the process of divination called “Derb
er raml,” or “Derb el ful,” according to the medium used, whether
it is sand or beans; the latter (with the beans) is the simplest,
but both are in principle the same. Seven beans are held in the
palm of the left hand, which is struck with a smart blow with the
right half-closed fist, so that some of the beans jump
into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span> the right
hand—if an odd number, one is marked; if even, two. The beans are
replaced in the left hand, which is again struck with the right,
and the result marked below the first. This being repeated four
times gives the first figure, and the operation is performed until
there are obtained four figures, which are placed side by side in a
square; these are then read vertically and perpendicularly, and
also from corner to corner, thus giving in all ten figures. As each
may contain four odd or four even numbers, they are capable of
sixteen permutations, each of which has a separate signification,
and a proper <em>house</em> or part of the square in which it
should appear. The Derb er-raml is only distinguished from this by
being more complicated, fresh combinations being obtained by the
addition of every pair of figures. There is a large work on this
subject by El-Zenāty, and another called ’Omdat-et-Taleb.</p>

<p>One day the Gibely came to me in all his Friday gaiety of
attire, “perfumed like a milliner,” his eyes broadly painted with
kohl. We had a long discussion on the earth and its form, and the
great sea which surrounds it, and jebel kaf which bounds it, and
the seven climates, and the seven heavens, for whose existence he
quoted the words of Him whose name be exalted! in the Koran. I
demurred to some of his theories, and treated jebel kaf and the
seven climates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span> as
at least old-fashioned—with the heavens, may they never be fewer! I
did not interfere; but even with the aid of such maps as I had at
hand, I could not, of course, hope to make my very modern notion of
the world’s form perfectly intelligible. From this we passed, by an
easy transition (arising, I think, from his assertion that Mecca is
the centre of the world), to the subject of natural and
supernatural knowledge, and thence to miracles. Reason being as
much opposed to the mysteries of faith as to a belief in
occurrences out of the usual course of nature, it is difficult to
prescribe a term to the one without seeming to doubt the other; and
I therefore, without entering into explanations, was content to
say, “It seems strange, but God only knows.” He himself pretended
to be able to travel from here to Benghazi and Derna, in summer,
through the parched desert, alone, without water or wallet, and to
want for nothing—an assertion he has often made to me, as of a
thing notorious to all in Siwah, ascribing the gift at one time to
his attendant djin, at another to the Sheikh Senusi. To-day, I
suppose because it was Friday, the living saint had the credit of
the prodigy. The Senusi, of whom I have had so often occasion to
speak, is the founder of the largest religious brotherhood at
present existing in Africa, its ramifications extending from
Morocco to the Hedjay. He is a native of Mostaghānem,
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span> educated in
Fez, and now resides in Mecca, where he has beside his house a
large zavia. He is about sixty-five years old, and from the immense
influence which he has acquired it may fairly be supposed that he
is a man of no ordinary talents. He is a sherif of good family, and
the donations of pious pilgrims have rendered his zavias (convents)
very wealthy. The members of these convents, after having completed
their studies, are allowed to marry, and without practising any
great austerities they are very strict Moslemin. In imitation of
the Prophet they say fifty rika’ats in the twenty-four hours, five
of which are said at midnight; they fast, in addition to Ramazan,
on certain days in the months of Sha’aban, Hedjib, and Zil Hidjih,
and abstain from smoking and drinking coffee, tea being their usual
beverage. They seem less fanatical than the general mass of Arabs;
although their founder is a native of Algiers, he professes, though
perhaps only from policy, a particular esteem for the English, and
I believe I had, very unworthily, the benefit of this partiality.
From one of the disciples of the sheikh I learned a point in our
national history which was new to me. When the Prophet died, the
English were on the point of becoming true believers, but, learning
his death, they determined to remain as they were; they made,
however, a treaty with Abou Behr, by which it was agreed, that
though they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
continued Christians, there should be perpetual amity between them
and the Caliph.</p>

<p>The Senusi is represented to me as all that an Arab saint should
be—exact in the observances of religion, gay, and a capital shot;
he rides a horse of the purest breed and of great value, dresses
magnificently, paints his eyes with kohl and his beard with henna.
He is very hospitable, and if the Gibely may be believed, has a
granary which the large daily drafts he makes on it never empty;
receiving nothing from any one, he has always money; and a hundred,
or even two hundred, persons eat from his dish of cuscusu, which
miraculously suffices for them all. The Senusi seems a man
respectable for his talents and probity, though from the above
history of him it may be supposed that he takes advantage of the
veneration of his disciples to impose on their credulity. In the
eyes of my Moghrabi friend, however, he is not the only living
thaumaturge in Islam; for there are, he asserts, many individuals
in Morocco, some of whom he knows personally, who pray every day at
Mecca, and he told of one who, no saint himself, owed this favour
to the sheikh he served. The event happened in Tunis. The servant
wished to go on the pilgrimage, but from day to day his master
dissuaded him, saying, “There is time, wait yet a little.” Thus
passed the months; the festival was approaching, and still the
sheikh answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">[269]</span>
“You shall make this year’s pilgrimage, but there is still time.”
At length the ninth of Til Hidj came, the very day of the sermon on
Mount Arafat, when, about mid-day, the sheikh called him, and said,
“Shut your eyes,” and “now open them.” He obeyed, and found himself
with a multitude of people at Mount Arafat. He performed with them
the ceremonies of the pilgrimage, joining in the processional
prayers, and after this spoke to many of his Tunisian acquaintance.
He said he should return before them, and offered to carry letters,
many of which, sealed with their seals, and referring to their
children and family affairs, were given to him. His master, who was
with him all this time, then said, “Shut your eyes,” and in an
instant he found himself again in Tunis, with his letters. He
delivered them the next day; but, notwithstanding the evidence of
the seals and the contents, the people, seeing the date, said, “He
is an impostor.” “Wait,” was the answer, “till the return of the
Hadj.” Meantime, at Arafat, his countrymen looked for him, and not
seeing him, said among themselves, “He is gone back before us to
Mecca;” but when after months they returned home, and each
recognising his own letter asserted that he had sent it from
Arafat, and had seen the bearer there, the people were convinced of
the miracle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">[270]</span>Miracles
performed by mad saints are not less firmly believed by my friend.
There is such an one at Damanhur, and I had myself the pleasure of
seeing him when there, who, clothed in the costume of Sultan Adam
when he left the hands of his Creator, is building a mosque at
Tunis. He goes every day to the Nile, and throws stones into it,
which are at the same moment conveyed to Tunis, and arrange
themselves in proper architectural design. He told of another at
Tripoli, whose aid the crew of a ship at sea invoked in a storm,
promising him a recompense if saved. He was at that moment in the
bazaar; a man riding on a donkey was passing him, when he jumped
up, as if possessed, from the stall he was sitting on, knocked the
man from his seat, and ———. I should have continued the story in
Arabic (my oracular tongue furnishing no terms in which to relate
it), but I refrain, as the learned who could decipher the Arabic
are probably sufficiently good Oriental scholars to fill up the
blank in my narration. At this moment, said the truthful historian,
he appeared to the mariners, and when, two days afterwards, the
ship entered the port, the saint presented himself to claim his
recompense. But the devil was no longer sick, and the sheikh’s
salvage dues were now denied him. All the people, however,
testified that the scene with the donkey in<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_271">[271]</span> the market took place at the hour when
his aid was invoked, and, thus convicted, the promised reward was
given.</p>

<p>I might fill a volume with such strange tales, as the
treasure-seeker’s visits are frequent; he had a well-supplied
budget, and he freely communicated its contents, in the hope of
drawing me out in turn. He certainly thought I had private
information about the immense treasures which he believed buried
here; and whatever the subject we were discussing, he always
contrived to introduce in a corner of his talk, <i>in angulo sui
sermonis</i>, a question relating to them, or an inquiry as to the
process of rendering quicksilver solid. This was all that he was in
need of to discover the grand arcanum for turning the baser metals
into gold and silver. Did he know the quicksilver secret he was
master of all the rest, and of acquiring this he did not at all
despair. I told him that transmutation was a dream long exploded
among the learned; but I offered him the receipt how to make rubies
and other precious stones, only premising that the cost was greater
than the value of the newly-formed gem.</p>

<p>Having presented the Gibely to my readers, as a good specimen of
the fortune-seeking Moghrabi who abound in the East, it would not
be fair to omit some account of Sheikh Yusuf—a much rarer
character, because really an honest man; though the stories I
am<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">[272]</span> going to tell of
him, gathered from his own lips, may not seem to European readers
to bear out the fair praise I give him. He is a very remarkable
man, full of energy, and has made the best use of the education
which an early initiation in affairs gives. He knows the letters of
the alphabet, and this is probably the whole amount of his book
learning; but his memory is well stored with texts of the Koran,
verses of the poets, and those stories which are so pre-eminently
an Oriental accomplishment, and which he related with a vivacity
remarkable in this country of loutish stupidity. His father was
Sheikh el Beled before him, and at thirteen he was also sheikh,
giving his opinion freely, even against his father’s views. When he
was less than seventeen his father was murdered in open day, by
some of the discontented Siwy, one of his own servants heading the
conspiracy. Yusuf, thereupon, proceeded straight to Cairo, and was
by Mohammed Ali appointed Sheikh el Beled in his room. The Pacha
had given Siwah and the Little Oasis, with their revenues, as a
backshish to one Hassan Bey, who had reduced them to his obedience;
and the Sheikh told with gusto some stories of that time, which are
too characteristic to be omitted here.</p>

<p>When his father went to the Proprietor-Governor, he used to take
Yusuf with him, to make him acquainted with affairs; but only as a
listener. One<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">[273]</span> day
in the date season, a large number of Arabs, with their camels, had
come from the Okbar, or, as it is called here, the Gazelle-land, to
purchase dates. Hassan Bey coveted his neighbours’ camels, but was
perplexed how to become master of them without injury to his purse,
or incurring Mohammed Ali’s anger. He consulted Sheikh Ali, who
would give no advice, but only shook his head, and said, “Tyranny,
tyranny.” “I’ll tell you what you should do,” cried Yusuf, eagerly.
“What shall I do, my child?” “You shall buy them for fifteen
dollars a-piece, and lose nothing by the transaction.” He then
explained his plan, which delighted the Bey; but his father only
shook his head the more, and oftener repeated, “Tyranny.” “You,
Sheikh Ali,” said the Bey, “are a graybeard, and do not understand
government. Sheikh Yusuf is young and brave, and I will follow his
advice.” The next day the Arabs were told that the Bey wanted to
buy some of their camels, and that they must bring them to the
castle in the afternoon. Accordingly, before evening, more than
three hundred of the best camels were collected in the court; and
the Bey having ordered several sheep to be killed, invited the
owners of the camels to sup with him. After supper, the bargain was
struck for fifteen dollars a-piece, the Mufti and Cadi being called
to witness the agreement, which was drawn out in writing. All
parties affixed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">[274]</span>
their seals, and the money was paid down at once. After this, the
Mufti and Cadi rose to leave, and all were going to retire from the
castle, when the Bey said to the Arabs, “You are my guests; you
must stay here all night, and we will breakfast together in the
morning.” The bait was tempting to men who love animal food at the
cost of their friends; and the foolish Arabs remained after the
others had withdrawn. The next morning some more sheep were
sacrificed to the genius of hospitality; the Arabs ate with their
usual appetite, and took their departure; but, as they passed out
of the gates, each was forced to restore the money he had received
for his camels. Thus Hassan Bey purchased camels without their
costing him anything.</p>

<p>On another occasion, Yusuf helped him to make a not less
profitable speculation in oxen and cows. There were many defaulters
to the miri; and his father and the Bey were in consultation as to
the way to get from them their debt, or its equivalent. There were
many cattle in Siwah at that time, and Sheikh Ali proposed to take
them in payment, at ten dollars a-head, which was rather less than
their value; but Yusuf said, “No; take them at forty dollars
a-head, and follow my plan.” “What is your plan?” “When the dates
are gathered, return their oxen to the owners, making them buy them
back at the original price, and take from them the amount of
miri<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">[275]</span> that they owe
in money.” At so large a price, everybody was anxious to give his
cows instead of the miri and the Governor—good-natured soul!—gave
them credit for forty dollars on each one that was offered; but
sent the cattle back to their owners, saying he would take them
when wanted. In October, there was a plentiful date harvest, and
the Bey was chuckling over his intended finesse, when it occurred
to him that many of the cattle had died during the heats of summer.
He sent for Yusuf, to see if he could help him out of this dilemma.
“To those whose cows are alive, return them at the original price;
and as for the others, it is but just they should refund you the
forty dollars which their oxen cost, as they have never served you,
but remained and died in their keeping.” Thus, by a truly Turkish
calculation, the Bey bought cows without paying for them, and sold
them for ready money to their original owners, who were then made
to pay their arrears of taxes, as if there had been no question of
cattle; and who do not, perhaps, at this hour understand how so
fair a transaction resulted to themselves in a clear loss of forty
dollars on each of their beeves.</p>

<p>His own father was once the object of Yusuf’s practical
pleasantries. The town had rebelled, and the ringleaders of the
revolt were imprisoned in the castle. Sheikh Ali received money
from two of the worst, on<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_276">[276]</span> the promise of obtaining their liberty, and
in the afternoon went to the Bey to intercede for them; and being a
favourite with the Governor, he easily procured an assurance that
they should be liberated next morning. Yusuf learned what had
passed; so, after supper, he set off alone for the castle, and
asked admittance to the Bey. “What brings you at this hour, my
son?” said he, after the first salutation. “My father came here
to-day to ask for the liberty of such and such a one. Do you wish
to know the exact truth?” “Certainly I do; speak.” “Well, then,
know that, in truth, they are the worst men in Siwah; but my father
has taken a bribe to procure their pardon.” At this the Bey was
very angry; and, calling to the guard, he had the prisoners brought
out and beheaded on the spot. Yusuf returned home; and, next
morning, when he came to release them, his father found their
headless bodies lying in the court. “Of course,” said I, “your
father returned the money?” “To whom?” said Yusuf. “The men were
dead; and there was no one could say to my father, ‘You took a
bribe—return the money!’”</p>

<p>After telling these stories of my sheikh, it may seem incredible
when I add that, though feared as a most severe man, he was
acknowledged by all the Siwy never to have taken a bribe, or
committed an act of oppression on his own account. “If you do not
do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">[277]</span> such things for
yourself,” I said, “how can you commit them for others?” He
answered that the Osmanli only value a man as he serves them as an
instrument of extortion.</p>

<p>My long detention in Siwah must, by this time, have become as
wearisome to my reader as it was to myself; let me hasten, then, to
open my prison-doors, and pursue my journey to its end.</p>

<p>On the 14th of March, exactly six weeks from my arrival, about
sunset, there came running to my house some of my Siwy friends,
crying “Backshish for good news!” Two Arabs were to be seen in the
distance, who, soon after, arrived, and announced themselves as two
sheikhs, and very important and big-mouthed personages they were.
They were the avant-couriers of the detachment of irregular cavalry
(Bashi-buzuks), whom the Viceroy of Egypt had sent to my
assistance. One would have thought them the kings of the world,
from the airs they gave themselves, and the monstrous lies they
told; and had I been less accustomed to the assumption of
consequence in which Arabs, and, indeed, all Easterns, indulge,
until they have received a good lesson, I should have been really
frightened at having to entertain such important gentlemen. They
came to demand rations for the men and horses, which were to be
furnished by the town;<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_278">[278]</span> and, as a matter of course, ordered twice
as much as was really required; and, equally as a matter of course,
hardly got, I believe, half of what they demanded. This
contribution was, at my request, levied on the hostile part of the
town, and my friends escaped unmolested. It was not until the 16th,
in the morning, that my deliverers arrived, having come from Hhosh
ebn Issa, near Damanhur, in nineteen days. They were commanded by a
Turcoman, one Hassan Aga, the wahil, or major of the regiment, an
easy-natured soul, somewhat sulky withal, as assuming as all Turks
are, but only requiring to be held firmly in hand, and an assiduous
sayer of his prayers.</p>

<p>Such a commander never was sent in charge of troops; he had with
him twelve or fourteen officers (Buluk-Bashi is their title), and
every one of them seemed to think he had a voice in the command.
All matters, of whatever nature they might be, were discussed in
public, the very soldiers sometimes interfering with advice. Among
banditti, such a republican constitution may sometimes exist; but
that the most irregular troops in the world could be kept together
with such a system seemed impossible. The first day of their
arrival, after having received the Commandant’s visit, I went to
the castle in which the troops were lodged, and made a formal
request that he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">[279]</span>
would seize the Sheikhs of the Lifayah, with the Cadi, and the Imam
of one of the mosques, and carry them with him to Cairo, to answer
before the Viceroy. He said he could not do so, having no orders,
except to bring me away; to which I rejoined, that no doubt he was
quite right; and that I had only to beg a written acknowledgment
that I had required him to take them with him, but that he, having
no orders, was unable to comply with my request. This he absolutely
refused, even Turks being afraid of pen and ink; but, after five
hours’ talk between him and his officers, who were of various
minds, on the one part; and Yusuf and myself on the other, he shut
them up provisionally, excepting the Mufti, who had accompanied the
Sheikhs, and whom I offered to bail. After this, on my giving him a
written demand for their arrest, with an order from Yusuf, as
Sheikh el Belid, he the next morning determined to carry them to
Cairo, and they were consigned to safe-keeping, with orders to
prepare for their journey.</p>

<p>Another day had been lost in this way; and it was only on
Friday, the 18th, that, accompanied by a soldier and three of
Sheikh Yusuf’s people, I started early to see the ruins of Omm
Beida, and any other antiquities which might be found in the oasis.
There was, of course, no longer any opposition on the
part<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">[280]</span> of the Siwy,
but the Commandant was very anxious to be off, and only with
difficulty agreed to give me till Sunday evening—far too short a
time to see the many ruins which are met with in the Hattyehs,
beyond the immediate territory of Siwah.</p>

<p class="csum">Antiquities of Agharmy. — Ruins of a Temple. —
Ancient Palace. — Acropolis of the Oasis. — Tombs of the Ammonians.
— Interior of Siwah. — Ruins of Beled er-Roum. — Many Ruins around
Siwah. — Preparations for Departure.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Riding</span> due east from the
large town of Siwah, through cultivated fields well covered with
green crops of young wheat, we came to an artesian well, which for
perhaps thousands of years has watered this part of the plain. The
water rises in a circular basin of ancient workmanship, which is
admirably built with large dressed stones, from whence it flows by
channels running in different directions. It is not very deep, and
the volume of water which it discharges is so small, that it was
emptied in two days, some few years ago, by persons in search of
treasure. All, or nearly all, the walls of Siwah are of the same
description; they were once more numerous than they now are; but
the mechanical genius of the present inhabitants is so deficient
that some of the wells, even within the memory of man, have been
allowed to get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">[282]</span>
stopped up by the falling in of their sides—one, for instance, on a
hill to the south, to which medicinal virtues were ascribed. A
circumstance which seemed to me worth recording is, that after a
shock of an earthquake (and shocks occur here at intervals of about
twenty years), the supply of water becomes more abundant; and even
old wells have been reopened by the convulsion.</p>

<p>After passing this well, we proceeded directly to Agharmy
(<span class="arabic" lang="ar">اغرمي</span>), the modern name of
the old acropolis of the Oasis. I had received several visits from
the Sheikh of Agharmy, who had shown himself always very friendly;
he had, in fact, on the death of his father, become a ward of
Yusuf’s. He had promised to show me all that his town contained;
but the jealousy of prying foreigners is such, that notwithstanding
the presence of the soldiers, and the good words of the Sheikh, I
should have left Siwah without seeing its most remarkable monument,
as all my predecessors had done before me, but for the information
given me by the Gibely. He had joined my party as a volunteer, with
the secret intention, I believe, of watching my movements, in the
hope that he should thus obtain some useful hints concerning the
places where the hoards of the unbelievers, which he is firmly
persuaded are concealed in all old ruins, ought to be dug for.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">[283]</span>Agharmy is built
on the platform of a lofty rock, which rises abruptly from the
level of the surrounding gardens. It is entered only by a single
gateway, from which a very steep winding road leads up into the
town. A guard is stationed at the door to prevent the admission of
any individual of the Lifayah, who, though only living at a
distance of three quarters of an hour, are never allowed to enter
it. This precaution is adopted in consequence of an old feud; the
Lifayah having fifty or sixty years ago seized the town and
expelled its inhabitants, who in turn, after several years of
warfare, surprised the conquerors with the aid of the Gharbyin, and
having recovered possession, they established sentinels, who still,
day and night, guard the gate. A shed is built just without it, in
which any of the Lifayah who wish to see inhabitants of Agharmy
must wait, while a message is sent to fetch the person who is
inquired for; and from this rule not even the Mufti is excepted.
The ascent is closed by a second door, through which I passed, and
presently arrived at a deep well, which I was assured is all that
the town has to show in the way of antiquity. It is circular, built
of regular layers of masonry, with stairs descending on the north
side. Diodorus mentions a well, lying not far from the oracle, in
which the animals for the sacrifice were washed; and this is
undoubtedly the same, as evidenced by its ancient
workmanship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">[284]</span> and
its being the only one in the place. It is about fifty feet deep,
and is said to be fed by the waters of seven springs, which issue
from the base of the rock on which the town is built. A few large
stones, remains of ancient building, are imbedded in some of the
modern cabins near this. When I had visited these, the Sheikh
assured me that there was nothing more to be seen in the place; and
being unwilling to provoke unnecessary jealousy, I was satisfied to
return. Proceeding ten minutes to the south, I reached Omm Beida,
that second Ammonium, which is mentioned as lying not far from the
town. It is still very much in the condition in which it was found
by Hornemann and M. Linaut de Bellefond, the author of the
description published under the name of M. Drovetti, to whom he
communicated it on his return.</p>

<p>All that remains of this temple are, one lintel of the doorway,
and part of what seems to have been the outer chamber which led to
the sanctuary. My measures give twenty-three feet eight inches for
the height of the remaining walls, and the inside width is fifteen
feet nine inches. The roof is formed by blocks of stone, stretching
from wall to wall, on each of which are two royal vultures,
displayed side by side, holding swords or feathers in their claws,
with bands of stars along the edges. The walls, of a limestone
filled with shells, quarried in a neighbouring hill, are
covered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">[285]</span> with
sculptures, stuccoed and painted blue and green. These sculptures
are in six bands, the fourth from the ground being filled with
perpendicular lines of hieroglyphics. The others are rows of
figures, the gods of the Egyptian mythology, who occupy the three
lower bands, diminishing in size in each successive band from the
ground. The only seated figure is the ram-headed Ammon, in the
third row. Above this, is a procession of figures bearing
offerings; and over this, a line of hawks, each bearing the
jackal-headed stick, and above its head the globe, with the serpent
issuing from it. The edifice is raised on a platform of rock; some
of the walls which surrounded the inner inclosure can still be
traced; but I could find no certain indication of the outer wall,
which was formerly visible in the north-east corner. At the end of
the platform, immediately in a line with the existing building, is
a subterraneous passage, which probably marks the position of the
sanctuary, as it would serve for the oracle. Some large masses of
alabaster are scattered about this part of the ruins, which have
been dug up in all directions by those most persevering of
antiquarians the treasure-seekers.</p>

<p>Some visitor of ancient or modern times has left his name on the
walls; and as I thought the vanity of seeking such a doubtful
notoriety excusable in this place, I copied it. In large roman
letters it is written<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_286">[286]</span>—“AMIRO.” Who, or of what age, Mr. Amiro
was, nothing indicated. A few yards to the south-by-south-west of
Omm Beida is the celebrated fountain of the sun, a large pond, in
several parts of which the water bubbles up, as if boiling. It has
a saltish taste, and the thermometer in it marked 85°, that of the
external atmosphere being 78°, affording thus a very appreciable
degree of warmth in the cold nights of the desert. At a short
distance, eastward from the ruins, is a place where, not many years
ago, extensive excavations were made by a Turkish Governor, as
usual, in search of treasure; his labour was rewarded by finding a
bronze lion and three statues of the same metal, though called, by
my native informants, gold. Returning from Omm Beida to Agharmy, I
found, in a garden to the left, ruins of a temple-like building,
consisting of two chambers; the first of which was twenty-two feet
by seventeen, the second twelve feet by seventeen. They are built
of very large stones, and on one side are fragments of fluted
columns, but no capitals, nor anything which, as far as we saw,
without digging, would indicate whether or not they belonged to a
portico.</p>

<p>I was now able to examine the town, as seen from the exterior,
occupying its lofty table-rock. I was astonished, as well as
pleased, to perceive in its outer wall, on the north side, a large
piece of ancient building<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_287">[287]</span> in perfect condition. This, as far as I am
aware, has not been remarked by any previous traveller, and I
eagerly inquired if there were any appearance of buildings
connected with this within the town. I was assured that nothing was
visible in the interior, houses being built against it; but
information which I derived from the Gibely induced me to return to
the town a few days later, and I now proceed to describe the
results of my second visit.</p>

<p>After passing the wall, a steep street to the right leads round
a large group of houses, in some of which I remarked ancient
foundations, and thence one reaches a very massive wall, built of
large stones. A doorway has been broken in this leading into the
court of a house. At my request this door was opened, and I found
myself in the forecourt of a temple or palace, now divided in its
breadth by a modern wall. On entering, to the right and left are
two immense doorways, now walled up, with a pure Egyptian outline
and well-cut cornice, but unadorned with hieroglyphics. This court
now measures sixteen feet by ten feet, but in its original state it
must have been nearly twenty feet wide. After much parley, the door
to the right was opened, and to my astonishment I found myself in
an apartment very low and dark, but whose sides were covered with
hieroglyphics. A modern wall divides it in length into two
chambers, and a flooring<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_288">[288]</span> seemed to have been added to make a second
story. Having penetrated so far, and being told there were no women
in the house, I went up-stairs, where I found the sculptures
continued on the wall up to a heavy projecting cornice, above which
the wall is undecorated. A window in the end of the second chamber
on this floor enabled me to see that it was the wall of this
building which I had seen from below. This chamber, in its original
dimensions, is about twenty-four feet long by fourteen broad, and
twenty-one high, and from its cornice, which seems calculated to
support a ceiling, I presume it consisted of two stories. In the
upper and further room, as it at present exists, I found on the
right a passage, made in the thickness of the walls, eight feet in
length by two in width, which may have served as a place of
concealment, there being no egress from it. In the lower room, on
the left, is also a small chamber, about six feet by four feet,
which seems to have formed a cupboard or some such repository.</p>

<p>Here, as at Omm Beida, I could see no appearance of a cartouche
among the sculptures on the walls; but I might have overlooked
them, if any such exist, as only a cursory examination was
reluctantly granted me by my guides; the walls, moreover, were
perfectly blackened by smoke, and the only light we had was that of
a flaring palm-branch. Leaving this<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_289">[289]</span> building by the door by which I had
entered, and turning round its exterior, I found the remaining part
of the wall of the court, with another large doorway, similar to
those I had already seen. Proceeding southwards from this I came
upon indications of walls, and from the edge of a hill of rubbish
to which I had advanced, I saw the wall just below my feet. I now
turned away, leaving the western door of the old building I had
entered behind me, and after a few steps came to a gigantic gateway
(under which the road passes) of less finished, though good
workmanship, and formed of stones of Cyclopean size. Other
antiquities may probably exist among the houses, but my time was so
short, and the unwillingness of the people to allow me to push my
investigations further was so great, that I was unable to make a
more satisfactory examination of the locality.</p>

<p>Agharmy is undoubtedly the ancient Acropolis of the Oasis, as it
is described by Diodorus Siculus. He says that it had three walls,
the first inclosing the palace of the kings; the second the women’s
apartments (the harem) and the oracle; the third containing the
habitation of the guards—this is, I believe, from Quintus Curtius;
having no means of examining the originals, I quote at second-hand
or from memory. I suppose that the building still so well preserved
is a part of the palace of the kings; and if the three
walls<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">[290]</span> are
understood as having been not concentric, but the chords of a curve
dividing the inclosure into three (the only reading which I think
admissible), we have the present town nearly exhibiting the
distribution of the old Acropolis. A wall, now principally formed
of houses, runs round the edge of the table-rock, and the town can
only be entered by a steep ascent on the south-east. At the
extremity of this, where the present guard is lodged, I suppose was
drawn the first wall, defended by the barracks of the Satellites.
In the space beyond this were the palace of the women and the
temple, near the well which still exists, separated by a wall (one
of whose massive gateways I passed under) from the royal
palace.</p>

<p>Outside the town, in the rock on which it is built, and nearly
beneath the remains of what I call the palace, is a cave eight feet
by six feet, which seems to have been formerly the mouth of a
passage cut in the rock, a postern from the Acropolis. The
abruptness of the sides of the rock, the fragments scattered round
its base, the springs which flow from beneath, the apricots and
pomegranate trees with their lively shade around it, render the
exterior view of Agharmy a most picturesque desert scene.</p>

<p>I spent an afternoon on the Gara el Musaberin, the hill of
mummies, which lies to the north-east of the town. Its surface is
literally, in every part, cut into<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_291">[291]</span> caves, all of which seem to have been
violated by the Siwy, those ransackers of tombs. In many there are
still heaps of bones, in general bleached by the sun; and in two I
found fragments of well-preserved remains, wrapt in a coarse cotton
cloth, with stripes of bright red and blue. Several of these tombs
exhibit great care in their execution, not a few, towards the
summit, have decorated portals, and many are plastered with a fine
stucco, on which are traces of painting in blue or red. The
Ammonians seem to have interred their dead without coffins, as
there are no remnants of wood scattered among the graves; and those
who told me of their discoveries here and in once cultivated tracts
to the west (though they had found many mummies), never seem to
have met with them in coffins.<a id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>To the south of Siwah is a curious hill called Gibel el Beyruh,
formed of five cones. It contains several excavations, which have
been used as tombs, but which seem to have been originally the
quarries whence the stone, for building the temple was taken. There
was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">[292]</span> formerly a
spring here, celebrated for its medicinal virtues, but now sanded
up, called ’Ain el Handalieh.</p>

<p>Accompanied by the brother of the Mufti, the only one of the
Sheikhs of the Lifayah whom I could trust, I went to see the town
proper of Siwah. We first went to the date yards (mestahh,
<span class="arabic" lang="ar">مستاح</span>), in which the dates
are piled up in great heaps, the ground being divided by stones,
which distinguish each individual’s property. These stone places
are three in number, and lie in the plain to the north of the town;
they are surrounded by a wall, with a gate to each, one belonging
to the Gharbyin, one to the Lifayah, and the centre one to members
of both communities. They said that thus left exposed to the sun
and air the dates will keep for a long time, neither subject to
decay nor to the attacks of insects.</p>

<p>Crossing the open space which separates the mestahh from the
foot of the town, we passed the chapel of Sidi Suleiman, who is the
most venerated Marābut of this place; he seems, indeed, to have
succeeded, in the estimation of the surrounding Arabs, to the old
sanctity of Ammon. All disputes and lawsuits, which in Moslem
jurisprudence are decided by the oaths of the parties, are
adjourned to Sidi Suleiman for decision; and many who fear not to
swear falsely by God and<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_293">[293]</span> his Prophet will speak the truth here, as
the Sheikh is said never to have left a false oath sworn in his
name unpunished.</p>

<p>From this place, entering by a flight of steps one of the
fourteen doors, I was introduced into the interior of the town. A
servant carried a lamp, which I soon found quite necessary, for
without a light no one unacquainted with the locality could find
his way through the dark lanes which run through the town. The
principal street, some ten feet wide by seven or eight feet high,
runs round the rock which forms the nucleus of this agglomeration
of houses; from this branch other streets, seldom more than four
feet wide, and so low that one must bend the head to pass through
them. There are four wells, two saltish, and two of sweet water;
into two of them the light is allowed to enter, the houses being
built round, not over them. Excepting here, neither air nor light
enter the town from above; it is not, therefore, wonderful that
every year Siwah is visited by a typhoid fever, whose virulence is
so great that during its continuance no stranger ventures to
approach the Oasis.</p>

<p>Having made the round of the place, and tasted the waters of its
wells, I was not sorry to return to sunlight, and again to breathe
a less stifling atmosphere. We now turned eastward, and crossed a
space surrounded by houses and containing some booths for
the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">[294]</span> market which is
held here during the date season; the space is called Sebucha
(<span class="arabic" lang="ar">سبوخه</span>). We then entered a
very pretty grove of palm-trees, dotted with the summer residences
of the wealthier inhabitants, and thence in five minutes reached
the small town of Menshich (<span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">منشيه</span>), built on level ground, and for the most part in
ruins. It was then completely deserted, all the inhabitants having,
on the approach of the soldiers, removed into Siwah.</p>

<p>Excepting the foundations of some of the houses on the Gara, the
western extremity of the town, in which I was lodged (where a layer
or two of masonry or cuttings in the rock may sometimes be
remarked), I saw no traces of antiquity in any of the buildings,
but, as of old, the houses are built with blocks of rock salt,
sometimes almost pure, cemented together with mud. From the dryness
of the climate this kind of wall is perfectly solid, and will even
resist artillery, the ball driving in only so much of the material
as will give it a passage. The reader must not, however, imagine
that the buildings of Siwah display the glittering appearance which
the fairy-like palaces in some of the German salt-mines present. To
the eye nothing is apparent but the mud with which they are
plastered, and they most prosaically resemble the rudest village
structures in Egypt.</p>

<p>The only excursion in the neighbourhood which I<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_295">[295]</span> could make was to Beled
er-Roum, of whose ruins, and the treasures concealed in them, I had
heard extraordinary accounts from the natives. It lies nearly north
by north-west from Siwah, the road leading over a causeway, built,
I believe, by a former governor, across the salt lake which bounds
Siwah on this side. The water is shallow, and from the film of
crystallised salt which covers it to a considerable distance, it
has the appearance of being frozen. Passing through groves of palms
and olives, we came in an hour and a half to a large mass of
shapeless ruins, built of sandstone and salt, called Dāhĭba. An
hour further through hills, all of them containing cave-tombs,
brought us to Beled er-Roum. We first came upon a collection of
small ruins, built of unburnt bricks, in one of which are two
well-turned vaults. In the rocks close to them are some
well-executed tombs, and I am inclined to ascribe a similar use to
these buildings, which may date from about the second century; the
people call them the houses of the infidels. A little further on
are the ruins of the temple, which, with a disposition resembling
the Egyptian, is of almost pure Doric architecture, without a trace
of hieroglyphics, and the stones of which it is built are only two
feet six inches by one foot. The cornice of the sanctuary, or
furthest apartment, is composed of four flutings; that of the
exterior room is one very large curve, whose outline is<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_296">[296]</span> completely Doric. There remain
now portions of only three rooms. The inner one, with two small
windows, is sixteen feet five inches in breadth by fifteen feet six
inches long. The centre room, with the same breadth, is only eight
feet six inches long; and the exterior one, now in great part
ruined, is fifteen feet eight inches long. Their height is eighteen
feet seven inches. The roof of the inner compartment has fallen,
and its masses encumber the sanctuary; of that of the second
chamber there still remain four immense stones, stretching from
wall to wall, like that of Omm Beida. The sanctuary is entered by a
large doorway with pilasters, and the space is narrowed by short
square pillars, with very broad capitals, which almost touch, so
that the passage left is only broad enough for one person, while
above there is formed by the summit of the capitols, a sort of
window cut off the height of the door. In front, and in a line with
the remaining building, extends a long substructure, the foundation
of the remainder of the temple, which seems to have three times
exceeded the fragment which is preserved, and about thirty yards
further on is an extensive vaulted subterranean, running at right
angles to the line of the temple.</p>

<p>All these buildings undergo continual dilapidations through the
researches of the treasure-seekers; and it is probable that, at no
distant date, this temple will in<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_297">[297]</span> this manner be entirely destroyed; for it
unfortunately happens that treasure, enclosed in a box of
obir-wood, is supposed to exist somewhere within the stones which
form the roof. I was shown a Moghraby manuscript, containing
detailed directions where to seek for treasures, and stating of
what they consisted.</p>

<p>Other antiquities exist in places round Siwah, their distance
varying from six hours to two days; but I was kept in such
uncertainty as to the time when we were to leave, and I was so
unwilling to take the responsibility of detaining the troops, that
I gave up my intention of visiting them. Mummies are not
unfrequently found in subterranean repositories built in the sand
of a Hattyeh five hours distant to the west; and in these graves
glass or earthenware vessels are sometimes discovered. There is a
place called Dogha (<span class="arabic" lang="ar">دوغه</span>), a
day and a half to the east, never visited by the Siwy, of which I
heard from a man who had reached it in tracking some lost camels.
He said that there was there a temple like that of Omm Beida, in
front of which were rows of warriors on horseback, cut in stone.
These may, not impossibly, be sphinxes. He further told me that the
earth in this Hattyeh is black, with a strong smell of sulphur when
thrown on the fire. I should be inclined to suppose this may be a
sulphate of some metal; the more so, that the Gibely told me a man
had brought, he knew not from<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_298">[298]</span> where, a handful of similar earth, which,
when exposed to the heat of a furnace, left a button of a white
metal in the bottom of the crucible. I think it is Caillaud who
speaks of sulphur mines in Siwah; but though the hot springs and
occasional earthquakes are a proof of volcanic action in this
neighbourhood, no one I spoke with had any knowledge of the
existence of either yellow or white sulphur.</p>

<p>At Beled er-Roum I spent an hour in the orchard of one of my
friends; and in vain attempted to put this time to profit by
learning the distinguishing marks of the different kinds of
date-trees. It requires a very practised eye to discover the
different varieties when not in fruit; the stems and leaves are so
similar in all, that my guide was unable to point out the marks by
which one is known from the other. The Siwah dates are of four
kinds:—the waddy <span class="arabic" lang="ar">وُدي</span>, used
for feeding cattle; the s’aïdy <span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">سعيدي</span>, which, with water, are pressed into a cake; the
gh’azaly <span class="arabic" lang="ar">غزالي</span>, a long brown
date; and, lastly, the most highly prized, the farechy <span class=
"arabic" lang="ar">فَِراخي</span>, whose fruit is short, nearly
white, and crisp, as if candied.<a id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href=
"#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">[299]</span>This day there
blew a violent chamsin wind, which raised clouds of sand, rendering
it almost impossible for any one to see a few yards ahead, and
against which spectacles were no protection. Nothing would have
tempted me to brave it but the necessity of being ready to start on
the following day. On my return, I announced to the Commandant that
I had completed my tour of the antiquities; and would detain him no
longer. My eyes and skin were still smarting from exposure to the
wind; and I was, perhaps, a little annoyed when he answered that,
Inshallah! we should start the day after to-morrow. But that day
was Tuesday, a bad day for starting; the next, Wednesday, was still
more unlucky; therefore, on Thursday, we were positively to go;
and, early in the morning of that day, almost before dawn, came an
officer to see if I were ready. By this time, I had learned a
lesson in punctuality, and did not hurry myself; but by eight, my
camels were being loaded, under the superintendence of one of the
Buluk-bashis, who seemed now to think every five minutes of value.
I knew that the eighty water-skins had not yet been filled, and
looked forward to a departure late in the afternoon as the most
that could be hoped for; but when at last, being fairly turned out
of my house, I took refuge at the castle, I found there was to be a
fresh palaver on the subject of the prisoners. I was<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_300">[300]</span> now thoroughly tired of the
question; and, like Falstaff, I was somewhat ashamed of the ragged
regiment who were to be carried in my suite, so I told Hassan Aga
he might do as he pleased on his own responsibility; whereupon, he
took from them a written engagement to present themselves, one and
all, at Cairo on that day month. I held my peace till all was done,
and they were dismissed; after which I drily said to him, “I have
no hand in the matter; not one of them will come.” And the event
proved that I was right.</p>

<p>It was now too late in the day to think of starting; and, having
made up my mind to preserve my good-humour, at least, as far as the
Egyptian frontier, I adjourned with Hassan to the front of the
castle, where a carpet was spread, and the officers, old and young,
joined by several of the men, gave us the amusement of a game of
the Jerid. I had never before seen this really graceful exercise;
but it has been so often described that I refrain from speaking of
it.</p>

<p class="csum">Leave Siwah. — Rude Sepulchres. — A Camel’s last
stage. — Sand Storm. — Find an Arab Cousin. — Corn hard to get at.
— Adieu to the Desert. — The Desert. The Oasis. — Arrive at
Cairo.</p>

<p class="nind"><span class="sc">Good Friday</span>.—<em>March
25th.</em>—It was eleven o’clock the next day before everything was
ready. The camels were loaded and sent on, and then, with loud
beating of the little saddle-drums, the horsemen forming a long
line, their colours in the middle, followed by Hassan Aga and
myself, we rode slowly out of Siwah. The officers cantered along
the line as it advanced, first one and then another, in no regular
order, and with no other apparent object than that of making a sort
of fantasia, as the Arabs call everything which they think amusing
or gay. A wedding festivity, a gaily-decked horse, or an
embroidered jacket, are all equally fantasia. My servants and the
slaves of the officers, Sheikh Yusuf and his friends, who in
considerable numbers accompanied him, for some hours brought up the
rear. The well-disposed part of the population<span class="pagenum"
id="Page_302">[302]</span> had come out to see the show, and to bid
me adieu; among them the Mufti and his brother, but none of my late
prisoners appeared in the crowd, to the great indignation of Hassan
Aga.</p>

<p>An hour out of the town the standard was furled, and then the
line was broken, and every one went as his fancy led him, excepting
myself, who soon found that I was considered either too suspicious
or too precious a personage to be allowed to stir a step without
Hassan Aga at my side. If I hung back, he did so too; if I rode to
one side, he not only followed me, but with him the little
tin-kettle drummers, and the nucleus of his army. As for
dismounting to gather a fossil, or to chip a rock, it was the
signal for a general halt; and I was therefore condemned to stick
to my saddle and follow my leader.</p>

<p>In three hours and a half we reached a Hattyeh called Wushky
Tamoushty, <span class="arabic" lang="ar">وشكي طموشتي</span>, where
we halted for some little time to allow the camels to come up.
Ponds of bitter water, palm bushes and mimosas, dot this plain,
which is infested by myriads of small, gray, singularly venomous
musquitoes. Two and a half hours further on, we came to some hills
called Gebel Melhiors, <span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">ملهيوص</span>, of the same tertiary limestone as those around
Siwah, and here the soldiers amused themselves by discharging their
guns and pistols<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">[303]</span> to
enjoy the repeated echoes of one of the rocks. It was half-past
nine, when, after passing Hattyeh el Kuttef, <span class="arabic"
lang="ar">الكثف</span>, we reached Omm Hoemem <span class="arabic"
lang="ar">هوُِهَم</span>, a line of low sand-hills covered with
trees; these supplied materials for making huge bonfires, round
which the soldiers lay themselves to sleep in parties of three and
four. The next day we were fourteen hours on horseback, riding
through a country presenting nothing remarkable; I give, therefore,
a mere catalogue of names. After passing a hill, Ingah Omm Hoemem,
we came to a table-land called Es-sutah, <span class="arabic" lang=
"ar">السُوطه</span>, from which, on the right, rises a rock called
Er-Rocheia, <span class="arabic" lang="ar">الرحيه</span>. The view
was bounded towards the east by low white hills, destitute of any
appearance of vegetation, called, from their colour, El-abiadh.
Here we halted for the night; the soldiers were in great
discomfort, as the place affords no means of making fires, and the
night was extremely chilly. Skirting El-abiadh we reached in three
hours a darker-coloured range, called El Achmar, and from this it
took us three hours to arrive at the palm-groves and wells of
brackish water, which lie on this side of the small oasis of El
Gara, as it is usually called, though also known as
Omm-es-soghaigh, <span class="arabic" lang="ar">ام
السغير</span>.</p>

<p>This is a miniature Siwah, presenting the same abundance of
water (which is here all bitter), and a<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_304">[304]</span> proportionate number of date trees. The
town, now almost in ruins, resembles Agharmy in its situation on a
table-rock, and is approached by a very steep path, which passes
under a gateway. Everything betokens the poverty and misery of the
inhabitants, who only number twelve grown men. There is a
tradition, that the population of the place can never exceed forty;
and whenever, by immigration (which they do not therefore
encourage) or by births, this limit is passed, some one is sure to
die. The male population seemed very well-disposed, coming at once
on our arrival to pay their court to Hassan Aga and Sheikh Yusuf,
and showing readiness to make themselves as useful as they could. I
never met with twelve such ugly specimens of humanity collected in
one place; and their virtues do not atone for their bad looks, as
they are said to be drunkards and lazy, taking no other care of
their date trees, about 21,000 in number, than drawing <i>lagby</i>
and gathering the fruit from them. They make no attempt at manuring
them, and do not even trim them, so that their produce is very
inferior to the dates of Siwah. The interior of the town is even
more ruinous than the promise of its external appearance; a
circular market-place, surrounded by fallen cabins, occupies its
centre, and it has near the entrance a well of drinkable water, 70
feet deep.</p>

<p>The brother of one of the two sheikhs who govern<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_305">[305]</span> this important territory acted
as my guide to see the curiosities of the place, and thinking,
perhaps, that he had not sufficiently earned his bachshish, he
insisted, as we came out, on showing the town gate. He closed the
massive door, formed of palm trunks, and, after drawing some
ponderous bolts, linked on an iron cable chain of the largest
dimensions, to show me how secure it was. I could not help smiling
at the precautions taken to close a place which contained nothing
of the smallest value, which drew from him a grave shake of the
head and the triumphant rejoinder, that a strong door and a big
chain are good things. In the rock on which the town is built are
four rudely-excavated sepulchres, and I saw many more in different
parts of the small oasis, but the rudeness of their fashion leads
me to conjecture that even in its most flourishing times this
dependency on the Ammonium never reached any high degree of
prosperity. Either this, or the lake of El Arachish, to the
north-west of Siwah, must have been the place where Alexander left
his escort in entering on the sacred territory of Ammon. We spent a
day and a half here, notwithstanding the badness of the water, from
which some of the horses had suffered in coming to Siwah, as the
Aga had forgotten or neglected to have bread baked for the soldiers
before starting. Leaving El Gara, we took almost a due northerly
direction, and made long days,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_306">[306]</span> as there is no water to be found for four
days. The horses of my escort had the bad habit of drinking daily,
which a thorough desert horse does not require, and, when possible,
the draught is given to them about midday. Immediately after
drinking, their riders mount them and give them a short gallop,
which I can only suppose is for the purpose of winding them.</p>

<p>The first landmark we reached was Gar-el-lebna, the milk hill,
thirteen hours off, the next six hours further on, Gar-ed-dih, the
cock’s hill. Many of the horses fell, as if struck with apoplexy,
on the second day, and on this day and the two following ones we
lost eleven. I ascribe the casualty to the water of the Gara,
which, stopping digestion, blew them up like a well-inflated
foot-ball, and after a few hours in this state, if injections,
fomentations, and bleeding had no effect, they dropped as if shot,
with all the appearance of a <i>coup de sang</i>. As ten of his
horses had died with the same symptoms on arriving in Siwah, I
suggested to Hassan Aga that as short a route might be found
leaving the Gara to the east, which would, perhaps, avoid any risk
there might be from a recurrence of illness among the horses. He
made no account of this; and now that one would have thought his
eyes must be opened to the results of his stupidity, he and Sheikh
Yusuf agreed in ascribing the misfortune to the Evil Eye, while
Yusuf looked grave, and said no<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_307">[307]</span> soldiers had ever approached Siwah without
being struck by the Eye in leaving it. Of course there was no
veterinary with the detachment; but what was stranger, not one of
the party seemed to have an idea of what to do; they had no physic,
nor even a fleam. The horses which recovered, as well as, I
acknowledge, some of those which died, were doctored by my servant
and myself, their owners seeming to have no resource but to sit
down and thank God that the Eye was on the horses, not on the
men.</p>

<p>We had made thirteen hours this day, but on the next, the
Commandant being anxious to arrive at water, as the skins were
rapidly decreasing under the charge of the Arabs, the camels made
seventeen hours’ journey, and the next day, in three hours, we
reached a well called Caldeh; it, however, contained so small a
supply that we literally drank it dry. From Omm Es-soghair to this
well the distance is forty-six hours. Though every day their loads,
principally water and corn, were growing lighter, a great many of
the camels were so exhausted that they dropped down, unable to
proceed. When no application of the stick would induce the poor
beasts to rise, their loads were distributed to others, and they
sometimes were able to continue the journey. But if they had been
driven too far before falling this was useless, and after a few
steps they would again lie down, when the camel<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_308">[308]</span> drivers would at once despatch
them, and then stripping off the hide, they cut all the flesh from
the bones to make a feast in the evening, so that within half an
hour a pool of blood and a skeleton were all that remained of their
long-suffering companion. I was unlucky enough to come up just as
one large white camel fell. It lay motionless, while its brutal
master, with heavy blows, endeavoured to force it to rise. In vain.
The escort stopped to look on, and I was so fascinated with the
expression of the dying beast’s head, that, though anxious to turn
away, I was an involuntary witness of its death. As all efforts to
make it rise were unavailing, a man threw it over on its side and
slowly cut through its long neck, from which an immense stream of
blood flowed, while he pronounced the words, “In the name of God
the Merciful, the Compassionate.” The camel made no resistance;
but, turning its head towards its butcher, uttered two or three
loud, heart-rending moans, which sounded in my ears for the
remainder of the day. I have seldom witnessed a more pitiable
sight.</p>

<p>Five hours beyond Caldeh is another and very remarkable well,
being a subterranean chamber hollowed in the rock, 72 feet square,
in the floor of which are nine wells, one in each corner, in the
centre of each side, and in the middle. Two are now sanded up, but
the others afford an abundance of water. The chamber<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_309">[309]</span> is eight feet high, and
presents every appearance of great antiquity; but there are no
ruins apparent in the vicinity, nor any town named in the ancient
geographies which could have occupied this place; perhaps, in its
origin, it served, as at the present day, as a reservoir for the
caravans from the south and west. We encamped here for the night,
as a strong wind, which had been blowing all day, had increased to
such violence that it was impossible to proceed. The air was filled
with sand of a dark orange colour, while the sun, an hour and a
half before setting, was of a pale blue, and could be gazed at with
the naked eye. Had we been in July instead of April, this wind,
which blew from the south-west, might have been attended with
serious consequences. In the night a great deal of rain fell, which
moderated its violence, and the next morning it had entirely
ceased. We were now leaving the region of sand, the ground being
dotted with a spare vegetation, which, in three hours from Bu
Battah, gave the country a general green tone, till on approaching
the sea this was succeeded by a strong, healthy growth of herbs and
grass, affording excellent pasturage. In eight hours we reached the
edge of the great platform we had been traversing, and by a steep
descent, of not more than 120 feet in perpendicular, we reached the
level of the sea, encamping, at the end of the ninth hour, in a
meadow of rank grass, separated<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_310">[310]</span> from the sea by a ridge of sand. A point to
the west forms here a small bay, and Baretoun, the ancient
Panetorium, lies a little beyond this. The name given to the place
we encamped in is Berbetat-el-mudar. We here passed the following
day to rest the horses, and to endeavour to obtain some supplies
from the Arabs who are usually stationed here, but who now, at the
instigation, I believe, of one of the sheikhs who were with us, had
run away. They were probably within a few miles of our encampment,
but so well concealed that every effort to discover their retreat
was useless; and thus the visions of sheep and milk in which we had
all been indulging were rendered illusory. From this place our
course turned to the east, riding over a plain raised above the
sea, of which we frequently caught a sight. Four hours eastwards is
a place called, by the Arabs, Fuhah; and half an hour further on we
came to the ruins of a small town whose walls are still to be
traced. Nothing that remains indicates the name by which it may
have been designated by Ptolemy, whose nomenclature is here, though
so near Alexandria, singularly defective. In six hours more we
encamped in a valley, surrounded by low hills, called Bu Jerabeh,
containing several wells of bitter water, one only of which was
drinkable. Here we found Sonagrah Arabs, whom their sheikh, Haj
Chalil, prevented from running away, so that we were<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_311">[311]</span> well supplied with fresh
butter, sour and sweet milk, and sheep, paying, of course, for all
that we took.</p>

<p>I ought already to have presented the Haj Chalil to my reader,
as he was the best of the Aoulad Ali whom I saw, and I exchanged
with him on the road many a friendly joke. A day or two after my
escort’s arrival in Siwah, a tall, stout man, of some fifty years,
entered my room, with a certain mysteriously solemn and
consequential air. When he had taken his place, he said to me, in a
low voice, that he had something very secret to communicate to me.
Of course, after learning that he was Sheikh Haj Chalil, I ordered
that no one should be admitted during the conference. He told me,
as if it had been a matter of life and death, that he was my
cousin, there being only seven grandfathers between him and me. The
relationship, thus precisely defined, tickled my fancy, and though
I supposed he must refer to descent from Spanish Moors, I begged he
would enlighten me on his pedigree. It seems that his ancestor,
whom he called Songor (hence the name of the Sonagra Arabs), was a
Frank boy, who had been washed on shore from a wreck near Sallum.
He was seized by the Bedawin, made the property of the Sheikh of
Aoulad Hharsuf, and in the end married his daughter, and became the
patriarch of a new tribe. The Arabs have no idea that one Christian
is not cousin to another; hence the<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_312">[312]</span> claim of relationship, which I acknowledged
ever afterwards, calling him son of my uncle. It was not, however,
only to have the pleasure of claiming relationship with me that he
came so mysteriously; it was to beg that, in consideration of this,
I would speak well of him to the Viceroy, so as to obtain his
nomination as Great Sheikh of the Aoulad Ali, under which name are
comprised the three tribes, Hharsuf, Sonagra, and Sinnĭna. I could
not promise to interfere in a matter in which I could have no right
to interest myself, and no power to be useful if I had done so; but
when the occasion afterwards presented itself, in the course of
conversation, I was not forgetful of my uncle’s son, though my good
offices were unavailing, as his Highness had already decided on
naming a sheikh from the Aoulad Hharsuf. And a lucky escape it was,
too, for Haj Chalil, as the possessor of the coveted honour, within
three months followed his predecessor on the road to Fazoughla—a
sort of penal hell upon earth—where, if he have good luck, he will
arrive, instead of being murdered, as the other is said to have
been, at Girgeh; for, I suppose, one must call murder the
condemning a man to one punishment, and secretly inflicting upon
him a heavier one—the loss of his head.</p>

<p>From Bu Jerabah we travelled over a slightly-undulating country,
covered with a short, wiry grass,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_313">[313]</span> called by the Arabs wild barley, which
affords excellent pasture for horses, till we reached Turbiat, in
five hours and a half. This was again a short day, as the camels
and horses were too tired to proceed. Here, after much scolding and
threatening of the Courbadj, we obtained a small supply of corn for
the horses—a necessity which was not agreeable to Hassan Aga, as he
had to pay here for what he required, while the corn he took in
Siwah was levied as a contribution on the town. The Siwy persuaded
the Arabs, who were glad to save their camels the extra weight, to
assure the Commandant that corn was to be had in any quantity after
the eighth day; but these same Arabs now took care to send on
before us during the night, to warn all their fellows out of our
way. As everything taken from the Arabs was fairly paid for, it
seemed mere spite on the part of the sheikhs who were with us thus
to increase the inconveniences of the journey, and I acknowledge I
was not sorry to hear that one of the most troublesome among them
had received from the Commandant’s own hands a rather severe
drubbing. Twenty-five hours were employed the two following days in
reaching the wells called El Hammam. We had now left the coast
line, but the next day, an hour and a half after starting, having
the Arabs’ Tower, or Abou Sir, the old Taposiris,<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_314">[314]</span> in sight, we passed through
extensive ruins, marking, perhaps, the site of Antiphræ, so famous
for its wine—it was so bad. At a considerable distance to the right
rise the flat hills of Hoshm el’Aish, which may be said to bound
the district of Mariout. We only made nine hours this day, stopping
at Caraya, where are five wells of ancient construction, the
largest built with very solid masonry, having an orifice of twelve
feet by three. The old Lake Mareotis is now an extensive plain,
covered with dark shrubs, and dotted with low, yellow mounds.</p>

<p>Two thousand female dromedaries belonging to the Viceroy were
stationed here for the pasturage, the best camel-browsing ground in
Egypt. I wondered to what purpose these were applied, and admired
his Highness’s tender solicitude for his stud of Arab horses, when
I learned that, immediately after the mares foal, the dromedaries
are sent up the country to supply them with milk. His horses are
decidedly the best lodged, best fed, and best cared for of the
present Pacha’s subjects. After passing two Marābut chapels, Abu
Hadidj and Sheikh Masa’udi, which lay to the right, we came to the
first village in Egypt, Gheitá, and stopped, eight hours from
Caraya, at El Hamra. The next day was the last of our weary
journey: in two hours we came to El Hhosh (Hhosh Ebro
’Isa),<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">[315]</span> which is
celebrated for its breed of falcons; and in six hours more we
pitched our tents outside the flourishing town of Damanhour.</p>

<p>Here ended my desert journey, and it was not without feelings of
pleasure that I found myself once more within the circuit of
Eastern civilisation. But it must not be supposed that I left the
desert without some feelings of regret. A prolonged sojourn in
those vast plains of sand,—condemned to a perpetual sterility—a
voyage over those waterless seas, is less devoid of interest than
at first sight one might be led to expect. They offer, indeed,
little variety, and they promise less; but this very monotony
renders the traveller more attentive to the varied aspects which
Nature even here presents, and awakens his attention to many an
object which in more-favoured climes he would pass unobserved. The
only variety of general feature is the passing from loose sand to
more compact gravel, or from boundless plains, which the wearied
eye ranges over without meeting an object on which to fix the gaze,
to equally desert hills, whose sandy solitudes are undisturbed even
by an echo. Sometimes, more awful still, one comes upon vast tracts
covered with small, dark, loose fragments, giving a chocolate
colour to the ground, which there seems to absorb the rays of the
mid-day sun, but without reposing the eye from its glare. The camel
here leaves no traces of his path,<span class="pagenum" id=
"Page_316">[316]</span> so that the solitary traveller must strain
his sight to keep in view the distant caravan; the dry tramp of his
horse alone disturbs the mournful silence; the sun is darting on
him his most burning rays; and, from the colour of the ground, he
seems to have lost even the companionship of his own shadow.</p>

<p>But this very silence, this monotonous absence of animation, are
of themselves impressive, and soon acquire a peculiar charm for the
imagination. The earth seems boundless as the ocean, not less
cheerlessly uniform than a sea becalmed, and not less dangerously
wild than it when roused by the strife of elements. The sky is pale
in the glare of mid-day, but glows with the brightest tints as
evening closes in; after sunset, it is again illuminated by the
zodiacal light, which fades to disclose a surface of the deepest
purple, spangled with thousands of stars, whose twinkling
brightness surpasses anything that our northern climates can show.
The desert, where no howling of wild beasts alarms the ear, no
watch-fire proclaims the vicinity of fellow-men, affects one less
with a sense of solitude than of vastness, and, like the sea,
awakens feelings rather of the moral greatness with which man is
endowed, than of the physical weakness which is his lot. Man,
alone, can traverse the broad desert; I have been days without
meeting the trace of a quadruped, or seeing a bird in the air; the
wind-worn rocks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">[317]</span>
bear no nourishment for the former, the restless sandwaves afford
no prey to the latter.</p>

<p>When, in this sea of sand, one approaches the rare islands with
which it is dotted, the eye is first attracted to the tracks worn
by the jackals and gazelles, which, making their abodes during the
day among the shrubless rocks, often twenty or thirty miles from
water, at night go to drink and feed in the oasis. Then the sand is
dotted with clumps of the zumaran, and other thick-leaved plants,
whose roots, stretching along the surface, draw sufficient moisture
for their existence from the air; round these may be marked the
tiny footprints left by the nightly gambols of the gerboa. A clump
of palm-trees, or a few mimosas, are at last seen on the horizon,
and welcomed with joy by the thirsty caravan; the camels now
increase their pace, the Arab’s step becomes more elastic, though
it will be hours before the wished-for spring is reached. Round
this are the blackened fire-places of former travellers, the deep
claw-marks of the vultures, the tracks of the fox, the jackal, and
the gazelle, the trail of the land tortoise, even the black,
rough-backed beetle, patiently rolling its load towards its hole,
each and all are welcome, as telling of the living world from which
the traveller has been separated.</p>

<p>Desert travel has its pleasures as well as its
tribulations.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">[318]</span> Of
the former I have said but little in the preceding narrative, for
hours of contemplation find no place in a note-book; of the latter
I have said, perhaps, more than enough, for annoyances which in the
retrospect are insignificant, seem proportionally great while one
is suffering from them.</p>

<p>The time of actual travelling from Siwah to Damanhour was 155
hours, a fair journey of thirteen days, which is the time the
caravans usually employ, while Alexandria is a day nearer. There is
another road which is easier for the camels, following the coast
line (in going <em>to</em> Siwah) from Berbetat el Mudar to Kasr
Adjubah, one day and a half. Thence to Jarjub, the same distance;
to Esh-Shamar, half a day; to Sallum, three days. Thence, turning
northwards, to Bir el Hhamza, two days, and thence to Siwah, three
days. The direct road to Siwah from Cairo is by Tervaneh and the
Natron lakes, but by this route of eleven days there are four
without water. From Siwah to Derna is a journey of fifteen days,
and to Benghazi twenty days.</p>

<p>I will not detain the reader by an account of my adventures
after reaching Damanhour. How the Turkish colonel of the Bashbuzuks
came to meet me, and then was inclined to treat me somewhat
cavalierly; how I recalled him to his senses, and how it
ended<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">[319]</span> in our
kissing and being friends; and my then spending a night with him at
Rachmania, from which place I embarked for Cairo.</p>

<p>This narration of a nine months’ journey, in countries little
known, however uninterestingly told, is at least faithful. I
believe, indeed, that the traveller who simply records what he sees
with his eyes and hears with his ears, and indulges in none of the
pleasures of the imagination, rarely meets with those stirring
scenes which, beheld by the fancy and treated with the pen of an
artist, so frequently charm the reader. My tale is true, and it
relates to what may still be called unknown countries; and this is
my reason for offering it to the public.</p>

<p>I am bound to express my obligations for the ready aid afforded
me by Her Majesty’s Consul in Cairo, during the absence or leave of
the accomplished Consul-General, whose departure, a few weeks after
my arrival, was a subject of regret both to Turk and Frank. It
would be unjust also to omit stating, that the Viceroy, within
twenty-four hours of the arrival of my letter, despatched orders
for the march of 150 soldiers to my relief; and, after my
presentation to him in Cairo, ordered another party of 200 to be
sent to disarm the town, and to bring forty-nine of the Siwy to
Cairo to answer for their conduct.</p>

<p>Sheikh Yusuf is reinstated, in more than his<span class=
"pagenum" id="Page_320">[320]</span> former authority, with a
garrison of twenty soldiers under his orders; so I flatter myself
that my prophecy to the Shiekhs of Siwah, that I should be the last
European they would ill-treat, is now fulfilled. I can now have the
satisfaction of feeling, that my successors in the exploration of
the antiquities of that country will meet with no obstacles to
their researches.</p>

and occasionally horsemen were met with, but generally two or three
together; for though the country is now peaceful enough, the
associations of other days seemed to deter them from venturing out
singly. In no part of the road did we see a trace of an encampment,
and the whole country seemed deserted excepting in the
neighbourhood of the wells. On my remarking this to my guide, he
said that the country was filled with inhabitants, but that they
pitch their tents in the places least likely to be visited by
passers by, to avoid too frequent calls on their hospitality. The
Arabs here have a great reputation for this virtue, but it appears
that they are not ambitious of exercising it.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class=
"label">[3]</span></a>When at Derna I was unable to obtain
information concerning the origin of the American battery which
seemed here so strangely out of place. I am indebted to Edwin De
Leon, Esq., Consul-General for the U.S. in Egypt, for the following
account of it. Achmed, Pasha of Tripoli, having been deposed by his
brother Yusuf in 1801, took refuge in Tunis. Before long the new
pasha found himself embroiled with the U.S., through capturing some
vessels bearing their flag. Determined to punish him, they offered
the ex-pasha the means of recovering his throne, but after long
negotiations he left Malta without effecting anything, and retired
to Egypt. His American allies had not, however, lost sight of him,
and they induced him, by a grant of supplies and the nomination of
an officer in their service, General Eaton, who took the command of
his forces, to march upon Derna. Of this place he easily got
possession, and it was then that this battery was erected. After a
few months, being deserted by his allies, who made a treaty with
Yusuf Pasha, in which his interests seem to have been little cared
for, he retired to Malta, and thence to Syracuse, where he lived,
partly supported by occasional sums granted by the Government of
the U.S., partly by a small pension which their representative
obtained for him from his brother. After various vicissitudes, he
returned to Egypt, where, as the guest of Mohammed Ali, he enjoyed
a liberal income. On his death a part of this was transferred to
his only son, but was suppressed by Abbas Pasha. I found the son,
now an old man, bedridden with palsy, in a state of frightful
destitution, dependent for his support on the charity of servants.
Mr. De Leon applied to the present Viceroy to obtain a restoration
of the pension the son had so long enjoyed, and by his
recommendation induced the Minister of the U.S. at Constantinople
to ask the Porte to restore a small property in Tripoli, once
belonging to his father, and of which he had enjoyed the revenue
during the late Pasha’s reign, but which the Ottoman Government
seized for its own benefit after his deposition. Hussein Bey
Caramanly, the surviving son of Achmed Pasha, is, as his father was
before him, an American protégé, up to the present time a very
useless title, but from which he is now, thanks to Mr. De Leon’s
energy, likely to obtain some advantage. His father’s story, in all
its details, is told in the Acts of Congress, 1807-8.</p>

<p><a id="Footnote_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7"><span class=

these pages were written, I find that he speaks of Ras Sem as a
name unknown to the Arabs to designate the promontory marked thus
in our maps. The coast, from a few miles west of Apollonia, has a
very gradual inclination southwards, but so slight that it is
impossible to designate even the place from which it begins to turn
as a headland. Shaw and Bruce’s account of the well five or six
days south of Benghazi agrees perfectly with the place called by
the Arabs R’sam; and although the very bitter well is eight hours
further on, there can be no doubt it is to this place that they
allude. The petrified city, with its inhabitants, does not exist;
its magnificent castle is only the Saracenic building, now called
Sheikh Es-saby; but the ground is to some distance strewed with
petrified wood. The dream of the city where “men are conspicuous in
different attitudes, some of them exercising their trades and
occupations, and women giving suck to their children,” is due, of
course, to Arab imagination, and not to those truthful
travellers.</p>

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
